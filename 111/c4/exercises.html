<h2>Programming Exercises for Chapter 4</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> several exercises for Chapter 4
        in <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.  For each exercise, a link to
        a possible solution is provided.   Each solution includes a discussion of how a programmer might approach the
        problem and interesting points raised by the problem or its solution, as well as complete source
        code of the solution.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.1:</h3>
<p>To "capitalize" a string
means to change the first letter of each word in the string to upper case (if
it is not already upper case). For example, a capitalized version of "Now is
the time to act!" is "Now Is The Time To Act!". Write a subroutine named
<span class="code">printCapitalized</span> that will print a capitalized version of a string to
standard output. The string to be printed should be a parameter to the
subroutine. Test your subroutine with a <span class="code">main()</span> routine that gets a
line of input from the user and applies the subroutine to it.</p>

<p>Note that a letter is the first letter of a word if it is not immediately
preceded in the string by another letter. Recall that there is a standard
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Character.isLetter(char)</span> that can be
used to test whether its parameter is a letter. There is another standard
<span class="ptype">char</span>-valued function, <span class="code">Character.toUpperCase(char)</span>, that
returns a capitalized version of the single character passed to it as a
parameter. That is, if the parameter is a letter, it returns the upper-case
version. If the parameter is not a letter, it just returns a copy of the
parameter.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.2:</h3>
<p>The hexadecimal digits are
the ordinary, base-10 digits '0' through '9' plus the letters 'A' through 'F'.
In the hexadecimal system, these digits represent the values 0 through 15,
respectively. Write a function named <span class="code">hexValue</span> that uses a
<span class="code">switch</span> statement to find the hexadecimal value of a given character.
The character is a parameter to the function, and its hexadecimal value is the
return value of the function. You should count lower case letters 'a' through
'f' as having the same value as the corresponding upper case letters. If the
parameter is not one of the legal hexadecimal digits, return <span class="code">-1</span> as the value of
the function.</p>


<p>A hexadecimal integer is a sequence of hexadecimal digits, such as 34A7,
FF8, 174204, or FADE. If <span class="code">str</span> is a string containing a hexadecimal
integer, then the corresponding base-10 integer can be computed as follows:</p>


<pre>value = 0;
for ( i = 0; i &lt; str.length();  i++ )
   value = value*16 + hexValue( str.charAt(i) );</pre>


<p>Of course, this is not valid if <span class="code">str</span> contains any characters that
are not hexadecimal digits. Write a program that reads a string from the user.
If all the characters in the string are hexadecimal digits, print out the
corresponding base-10 value. If not, print out an error message.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.3:</h3>
<p>Write a function that
simulates rolling a pair of dice until the total on the dice comes up to be a
given number. The number that you are rolling for is a parameter to the
function. The number of times you have to roll the dice is the return value of
the function. The parameter should be one of the possible totals:
2, 3, ..., 12.  The function should throw an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>
if this is not the case.  Use your function in a program that computes and prints the
number of rolls it takes to get snake eyes. (Snake eyes means that the total
showing on the dice is 2.)</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.4:</h3>
<p>This exercise builds on <a href="../c4/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.3</a>.
Every time you roll the dice repeatedly, trying to get a given
total, the number of rolls it takes can be different. The question naturally
arises, what's the average number of rolls to get a given total? Write a function that performs the
experiment of rolling to get a given total 10000 times. The desired total is a
parameter to the subroutine. The average number of rolls is the return value.
Each individual experiment should be done by calling the function you wrote for
<a href="../c4/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.3</a>. Now, write a main program that will call your function once for
each of the possible totals (2, 3, ..., 12). It should make a table of the
results, something like:</p>


<pre>Total On Dice     Average Number of Rolls
-------------     -----------------------
       2               35.8382
       3               18.0607
       .                .
       .                .</pre>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.5:</h3>
<p>The sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomMosaicWalk.java">RandomMosaicWalk.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a> shows a "disturbance" that wanders around a
grid of colored squares. When the disturbance visits a square, the color of
that square is changed. The applet at the bottom of 
<a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a> 
shows a variation on this idea. In this applet, all the squares start
out with the default color, black. Every time the disturbance visits a square,
a small amount is added to the red component of the color of that square. Write
a subroutine that will add 25 to the red component of one of the squares in the
mosaic. The row and column numbers of the square should be passed as parameters
to the subroutine. Recall that you can discover the current red component of
the square in row <span class="code">r</span> and column <span class="code">c</span> with the function call
<span class="code">Mosaic.getRed(r,c)</span>. Use your subroutine as a substitute for the
<span class="code">changeToRandomColor()</span> subroutine in the program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomMosaicWalk2.java">RandomMosaicWalk2.java</a></span>.
(This is the improved version of the program from <a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a> that uses named constants for
the number of rows, number of columns, and square size.) Set the number of rows
and the number of columns to 80. Set the square size to 5.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.6:</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you
will write another program  based on the non-standard <span class="code">Mosaic</span> class that was
presented in <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>.  While the program does not do anything
particularly interesting, it's interesting as a programming problem.  The program
will do the same thing as the following applet:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="MosaicStrobeApplet.java" width="205" height="205" alt=""></applet></p>
   

<p>The program will show a rectangle that grows from the center of the applet to the
edges, getting brighter as it grows. The rectangle is made up of the little
squares of the mosaic. You should first write a subroutine that draws a
rectangle on a <span class="code">Mosaic</span> window. More specifically, write a subroutine
named <span class="code">rectangle</span> such that the subroutine call statement</p>


<pre>rectangle(top,left,height,width,r,g,b);</pre>


<p>will call <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor(row,col,r,g,b)</span> for each little square
that lies on the outline of a rectangle. The topmost row of the rectangle is
specified by <span class="code">top</span>. The number of rows in the rectangle is specified by
<span class="code">height</span> (so the bottommost row is <span class="code">top+height-1</span>). The leftmost
column of the rectangle is specified by <span class="code">left</span>. The number of columns in
the rectangle is specified by <span class="code">width</span> (so the rightmost column is
<span class="code">left+width-1</span>.)</p>


<p>The animation loops through the same sequence of steps over and over. In each
step, a rectangle is drawn in gray (that is, with all three color components
having the same value). There is a pause of 200 milliseconds so the user can
see the rectangle. Then the very same rectangle is drawn in black, effectively
erasing the gray rectangle. Finally, the variables giving the top row, left
column, size, and color level of the rectangle are adjusted to get ready for
the next step. In the applet, the color level starts at 50 and increases by 10
after each step. When the rectangle gets to the outer edge of the applet, the
loop ends.  The animation then starts again at the beginning of the loop.
You might want to make a subroutine that does one loop through
all the steps of the animation.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">main()</span> routine simply opens a Mosaic window and then does the
animation loop over and over until the user closes the window. There is a 1000
millisecond delay between one animation loop and the next. Use a Mosaic window
that has 41 rows and 41 columns. (I advise you <b>not</b> to used
named constants for the numbers of rows and columns, since the problem is
complicated enough already.)</p>
