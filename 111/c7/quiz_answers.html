<p>What does the computer do
when it executes the following statement? Try to give as complete an answer as
possible.</p>

<pre>Color[]  palette  =  new  Color[12];</pre>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>This is a declaration statement,
that declares and initializes a variable named <span class="code">palette</span> of type
<span class="atype">Color[]</span>. The initial value of this variable is a newly created array
that has space for 12 items. To be specific about what the computer does: It
creates a new 12-element array object on the heap, and it fills each space in
that array with <span class="code">null</span>. It allocates a memory space for the variable,
<span class="code">palette</span>. And it stores a pointer to the new array object in that
memory space.</p>

<p>What is meant by the <i>basetype</i> of an array?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The base type of an array refers
to the type of the items that can be stored in that array. For example, the
base type of the array in the previous problem is <span class="code">Color</span>.</p>

<p>What does it mean to sort an array?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>To sort an array means to
rearrange the items in the array so that they are in increasing or decreasing
order (according to some criterion).</p>

<p>What is the main advantage of binary search over linear search?  What is the
main disadvantage?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The advantage of binary search is that it is much faster.  On a list of
one million items, linear search would take an average of five hundred thousand steps to find an
item, whereas binary search would take only 20 steps.  The disadvantage is that
binary search only works on a sorted list, so some extra work must be done to
keep the sort the list or to keep the list in sorted order as it is created.</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</span></td><td>
<p>What is meant by a
<i>dynamic array?</i> What is the advantage of a dynamic array over a regular
array?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>A dynamic array is like an array
in that it is a data structure that stores a sequence of items, all of the same
type, in numbered locations. It is different from an array in that there is no
preset upper limit on the number of items that it can contain. This is an
advantage in situations where a reasonable value for the size of the array is
not known at the time it is created.</p>

<p>Suppose that a variable <span class="code">strlst</span> has been declared as</p>

<pre>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; strlst = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</pre>

<p>Assume that the list is not empty and that all the items in the list
are non-null. Write a code segment that will find and print the string in the list
that comes first in lexicographic order.  How would your answer change
if <span class="code">strlst</span> were declared to be of type <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
instead of <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span>?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>Strings can be compared for lexicographic order using the <span class="code">compareTo</span>
instance method in the <span class="classname">String</span> class.
We can find the smallest string as follows:</p>

<pre>String smallest = strlst.get(0);
for (int i = 1; i &lt; strlist.size(); i++) {
   String nextString = strlst.get(i);
   if ( nextString.compareTo(smallest) &lt; 0 ) 
       smallest = nextString;
}
System.out.println("The smallest string lexicographically is " + smallest);</pre>

<p>If <span class="code">strlst</span> were declared to be of type <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
then the return type of <span class="code">strlst.get(i)</span> would be <span class="classname">Object</span>
instead of <span class="classname">String</span>, and a type-cast would be necessary to convert
the returned value to type <span class="classname">String</span>:</p>

<pre>String smallest = <span class="newcode">(String)</span>strlst.get(0);
for (int i = 1; i &lt; strlist.size(); i++) {
   String nextString = <span class="newcode">(String)</span>strlst.get(i);
   if ( nextString.compareTo(smallest) &lt; 0 ) 
       smallest = nextString;
}
System.out.println("The smallest string lexicographically is " + smallest);</pre>

<p>Furthermore, it now has to be <b>assumed</b> that every item in the list is in
fact a string, since objects of any type could now be legally stored in <span class="code">strlst</span>.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the
following subroutine? What is the meaning of the value that it returns, in
terms of the value of its parameter?</p>

<pre>static String concat( String[] str ) {
   if (str == null)
      return "";
   String ans = "";

   return ans;
}</pre>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The purpose of the subroutine is
to chain all the strings in an array of strings into one long string. If the
array parameter is null, then there are no strings, and the empty string is
returned. Otherwise, the value returned is the string made up of all the
strings from the array. For example, if <span class="code">stringList</span> is an array
declared as</p>

<pre>String[] stringList = { "Put 'em ",  "all", " together" };</pre>

<p>then the value of <span class="code">concat(stringList)</span> is "Put 'em all together".</p>

<p>Show the exact output
produced by the following code segment.</p>

<tr class="answer">
<td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td><td>
<p>The output consists of six
lines, with each line containing six characters. In the first line, <span class="code">i</span>
is 0, so all the characters are *'s. In the last line, i is 5, so all the
characters are *'s. In each of the four lines in the middle, one of the
characters is a * and the rest are periods. The output is</p>

.*....
..*...
...*..

<p>It might help to look at the array items that are printed on each line. Note
that <span class="code">pic[row][col]</span> is '*' if <span class="code">row</span> is 0 or if <span class="code">row</span> is 5
