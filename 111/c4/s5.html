<span class="start"><big>A</big>s computers and their user interfaces</span> have become
easier to use, they have also become more complex for programmers to deal with.
You can write programs for a simple console-style user interface using just a
few subroutines that write output to the console and read the user's typed
replies. A modern graphical user interface, with windows, buttons, scroll bars,
menus, text-input boxes, and so on, might make things easier for the user, but
it forces the programmer to cope with a hugely expanded array of possibilities.
The programmer sees this increased complexity in the form of great numbers of
subroutines that are provided for managing the user interface, as well as for
other purposes.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.5.1">4.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Toolboxes</a>
</h3>


<p>Someone who wants to program for Macintosh computers -- and to produce
programs that look and behave the way users expect them to -- must deal with
the Macintosh Toolbox, a collection of well over a thousand different
subroutines. There are routines for opening and closing windows, for drawing
geometric figures and text to windows, for adding buttons to windows, and for
responding to mouse clicks on the window. There are other routines for creating
menus and for reacting to user selections from menus. Aside from the user
interface, there are routines for opening files and reading data from them, for
communicating over a network, for sending output to a printer, for handling
communication between programs, and in general for doing all the standard
things that a computer has to do.  Microsoft Windows provides its own
set of subroutines for programmers to use, and they are quite a bit different
from the subroutines used on the Mac.  Linux has several different GUI toolboxes
for the programmer to choose from.</p>


<p>The analogy of a "toolbox" is a good one to keep in mind. Every programming
project involves a mixture of innovation and reuse of existing tools. A
programmer is given a set of tools to work with, starting with the set of basic
tools that are built into the language: things like variables, assignment
statements, if statements, and loops. To these, the programmer can add existing
toolboxes full of routines that have already been written for performing
certain tasks. These tools, if they are well-designed, can be used as true
black boxes: They can be called to perform their assigned tasks without
worrying about the particular steps they go through to accomplish those tasks.
The innovative part of programming is to take all these tools and apply them to
some particular project or problem (word-processing, keeping track of bank
accounts, processing image data from a space probe, Web browsing, computer
games,&nbsp;...). This is called <span class="newword">applications programming</span>.</p>


<p>A software toolbox is a kind of black box, and it presents a certain
interface to the programmer. This interface is a specification of what routines
are in the toolbox, what parameters they use, and what tasks they perform. This
information constitutes the <span class="newword">API</span>, or <span class="newword">Applications Programming Interface</span>, 
associated with the toolbox. The Macintosh API is
a specification of all the routines available in the Macintosh Toolbox. A
company that makes some hardware device -- say a card for connecting a computer
to a network -- might publish an API for that device consisting of a list of
routines that programmers can call in order to communicate with and control the
device. Scientists who write a set of routines for doing some kind of complex
computation -- such as solving "differential equations," say -- would provide
an API to allow others to use those routines without understanding the details
of the computations they perform.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The Java programming language is supplemented by a large, standard API.
You've seen part of this API already, in the form of mathematical subroutines
such as <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span>, the <span class="classname">String</span> data type and its associated
routines, and the <span class="code">System.out.print()</span> routines. The standard Java API
includes routines for working with graphical user interfaces, for network
communication, for reading and writing files, and more. It's tempting to think
of these routines as being built into the Java language, but they are
technically subroutines that have been written and made available for use in
Java programs.</p>


<p>Java is platform-independent. That is, the same program can run on platforms
as diverse as Macintosh, Windows, Linux, and others. The same Java API must work
on all these platforms. But notice that it is the <b>interface</b>
that is platform-independent; the <b>implementation</b> varies from
one platform to another. A Java system on a particular computer includes
implementations of all the standard API routines. A Java program includes only
<b>calls</b> to those routines. When the Java interpreter executes a
program and encounters a call to one of the standard routines, it will pull up
and execute the implementation of that routine which is appropriate for the
particular platform on which it is running. This is a very powerful idea. It
means that you only need to learn one API to program for a wide variety of
platforms.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.5.2">4.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Java's Standard Packages</a>
</h3>


<p>Like all subroutines in Java, the routines in the standard API are grouped
into classes. To provide larger-scale organization, classes in Java can be
grouped into <span class="newword">packages</span>, which were introduced briefly in
<a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>.  You can have even higher
levels of grouping, since packages can also contain other packages. In fact,
the entire standard Java API is implemented in several packages. One of these,
which is named "<span class="code">java</span>", contains several non-GUI packages as well as the
original AWT graphics user interface classes. Another package,
"<span class="code">javax</span>", was added in Java version 1.2 and contains the classes used
by the Swing graphical user interface and other additions to the API.</p>


<p>A package can contain both classes and other packages. A package that is
contained in another package is sometimes called a "sub-package." Both the
<span class="code">java</span> package and the <span class="code">javax</span> package contain sub-packages. One
of the sub-packages of <span class="code">java</span>, for example, is called "<span class="code">awt</span>".
Since <span class="code">awt</span> is contained within <span class="code">java</span>, its full name is actually
<span class="code">java.awt</span>.  This package contains classes that represent GUI components
such as buttons and menus in the AWT, the older of the two Java GUI toolboxes, which
is no longer widely used.  However, <span class="code">java.awt</span> also contains a number
of classes that form the foundation for all GUI programming, such as the <span class="code">Graphics</span>
class which provides routines for drawing on the screen, the <span class="code">Color</span> class
which represents colors, and the <span class="code">Font</span> class which represents the fonts that
are used to display characters on the screen.
Since these classes are contained in the package <span class="code">java.awt</span>, their full names are actually
<span class="code">java.awt.Graphics</span>, <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span>, and <span class="code">java.awt.Font</span>.
(I hope that by now you've gotten the hang of how this naming thing works in Java.) Similarly,
<span class="code">javax</span> contains a sub-package named <span class="code">javax.swing,</span> which
includes such classes as <span class="code">javax.swing.JButton</span>, <span class="code">javax.swing.JMenu</span>, and
<span class="code">javax.swing.JFrame</span>.  The GUI classes in <span class="code">javax.swing</span>, together with the
foundational classes in <span class="code">java.awt</span>, are all part of the API that makes it possible
to program graphical user interfaces in Java.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">java</span> package includes several other sub-packages, such as
<span class="code">java.io</span>, which provides facilities for input/output,
<span class="code">java.net</span>, which deals with network communication, and
<span class="code">java.util</span>, which provides a variety of "utility" classes. The
most basic package is called <span class="code">java.lang</span>. This package contains
fundamental classes such as <span class="classname">String</span>, <span class="classname">Math</span>,
<span class="classname">Integer</span>, and <span class="classname">Double</span>.</p>


<p>It might be helpful to look at a graphical representation of the levels of
nesting in the <span class="code">java</span> package, its sub-packages, the classes in those
sub-packages, and the subroutines in those classes. This is not a complete
picture, since it shows only a very few of the many items in each element:</p>



<p align="center">
<img src="nesting.png" width="419" height="295" alt="(Diagram of subroutine/class/package nesting)"></p>
   

<p>The official documentation for the standard Java 5.0 API
lists 165 different packages, including sub-packages, and
it lists 3278 classes in these packages.  Many of these are rather obscure or
very specialized, but you might want to browse through the documentation to see
what is available.  As I write this, the
documentation for the complete API can be found at</p>

<pre>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Even an expert programmer won't be familiar with the entire API,
or even a majority of it.  In this book, you'll only encounter
several dozen classes, and those will be sufficient for writing a 
wide variety of programs.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.5.3">4.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Classes from Packages</a>
</h3>


<p>Let's say that you want to use the class <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span> in a
program that you are writing.  Like any class, <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span> is
a type, which means that you can use it to declare variables and parameters and
to specify the return type of a function. One way to do this is to use the
full name of the class as the name of the type. For example, suppose that you
want to declare a variable named <span class="code">rectColor</span> of type <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span>.
You could say:</p>


<pre>java.awt.Color  rectColor;</pre>


<p>This is just an ordinary variable declaration of the form
"<span class="bnf">type-name</span>&nbsp;<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>;".
Of course, using the full name of every class can get tiresome, so Java makes it
possible to avoid using the full name of a class by <span class="newword">importing</span>
the class. If you put</p>


<pre>import java.awt.Color;</pre>


<p>at the beginning of a Java source code file, then, in the rest of the file,
you can abbreviate the full name <span class="code">java.awt.Color</span> to just the simple name of
the class, <span class="code">Color</span>.  Note that the <span class="code">import</span> line comes at the start of 
a file and is not inside any class.  Although it is sometimes referred to
as a statement, it is more properly called an <span class="newword">import directive</span>
since it is not a statement in the usual sense.  Using this <span class="code">import</span>
directive would allow you to say</p>


<pre>Color  rectColor;</pre>


<p>to declare the variable.  Note that the only effect of the
<span class="code">import</span> directive is to allow you to use simple class names instead of
full "package.class" names; you aren't really importing anything substantial.
If you leave out the <span class="code">import</span> directive, you can still access the class -- you 
just have to use its full name.  There is a shortcut for importing all
the classes from a given package. You can import all the classes from
<span class="code">java.awt</span> by saying</p>


<pre>import java.awt.*;</pre>


<p>The "<span class="code">*</span>" is a <span class="newword">wildcard</span> that matches every class in the package.
(However, it does not match sub-packages; you <b>cannot</b> import the entire
contents of all the sub-packages of the <span class="code">java</span> package by saying
<span class="code">import&nbsp;java.*</span>.)</p>
   

<p>Some programmers think that using a wildcard in an <span class="code">import</span> statement
is bad style, since it can make a large number of class names available that you are
not going to use and might not even know about.  They think it is better to explicitly
import each individual class that you want to use.  In my own programming, I often
use wildcards to import all the classes from the most relevant packages, and use
individual imports when I am using just one or two classes from a given package.</p>


<p>In fact, any Java program that uses a graphical user interface is likely to
use many classes from the <span class="code">java.awt</span> and <span class="code">javax.swing</span> packages
as well as from another package named <span class="code">java.awt.event</span>, 
and I usually begin such programs with</p>
   

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;</pre>
   

<p>A program that works with networking might include the line
"<span class="code">import java.net.*;</span>", while one that reads or writes files might
use "<span class="code">import java.io.*;</span>".  (But when you start importing lots
of packages in this way, you have to be careful about one thing: It's possible
for two classes that are in different packages to have the same name. For
example, both the <span class="code">java.awt</span> package and the <span class="code">java.util</span> package
contain classes named <span class="code">List</span>. If you import both <span class="code">java.awt.*</span> and
<span class="code">java.util.*</span>, the simple name <span class="code">List</span> will be ambiguous. If you
try to declare a variable of type <span class="code">List</span>, you will get a compiler error
message about an ambiguous class name. The solution is simple: Use the full
name of the class, either <span class="code">java.awt.List</span> or <span class="code">java.util.List</span>.
Another solution, of course, is to use <span class="code">import</span> to import the individual classes you
need, instead of importing entire packages.)</p>


<p>Because the package <span class="code">java.lang</span> is so fundamental, all the classes in
<span class="code">java.lang</span> are <b>automatically</b> imported into every
program. It's as if every program began with the statement "<span class="code">import
java.lang.*;</span>". This is why we have been able to use the class name
<span class="classname">String</span> instead of <span class="code">java.lang.String</span>, and <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span>
instead of <span class="code">java.lang.Math.sqrt()</span>. It would still, however, be
perfectly legal to use the longer forms of the names.</p>


<p>Programmers can create new packages. Suppose that you want some classes that
you are writing to be in a package named <span class="code">utilities</span>. Then the source
code file that defines those classes must begin with the line</p>


<pre>package utilities;</pre>


<p>This would come even before any <span class="code">import</span> directive in that file.
Furthermore, as mentioned in <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>, the source code file
would be placed in a folder with the same name as the package.  A class that is
in a package automatically has access to other classes in the same package; that is,
a class doesn't have to import the package in which it is defined.</p>
   

<p>In projects that define large numbers of classes, it makes sense to organize
those classes into packages. It also makes sense for programmers to
create new packages as toolboxes that provide functionality and APIs for
dealing with areas not covered in the standard Java API. (And in fact such
"toolmaking" programmers often have more prestige than the applications
programmers who use their tools.)</p>


<p>However, I will not be creating any packages in this textbook. For the purposes of this
book, you need to know about packages mainly so that you will be able to import the standard
packages. These packages are always available to the programs that you write.
You might wonder where the standard classes are actually located.  Again, that can
depend to some extent on the version of Java that you are using, but in the standard
Java 5.0, they are stored in <span class="newword">jar files</span> in a subdirectory of the main Java installation
directory.  A jar (or "Java archive") file is a single file that can contain many classes.
Most of the standard classes can be found in a jar file named <span class="code">classes.jar</span>.
In fact, Java programs are generally distributed in the form of jar files, instead of as
individual class files.</p>


<p>Although we won't be creating packages explicitly, <b>every</b>
class is actually part of a package. If a class is not specifically placed in a
package, then it is put in something called the <span class="newword">default package</span>, 
which has no name.  All the examples that you see in this book
are in the default package.</p>
   

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.5.4">4.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Javadoc</a>
</h3>
   

<p>To use an API effectively, you need good documentation for it.  The documentation for
most Java APIs is prepared using a system called <span class="newword">Javadoc</span>.  For example,
this system is used to prepare the documentation for Java's standard packages.  And almost
everyone who creates a toolbox in Java publishes Javadoc documentation for it.</p>
   

<p>Javadoc documentation is prepared from special comments that are placed in the Java
source code file.  Recall that one type of Java comment begins with <span class="code">/*</span> and ends with&nbsp;<span class="code">*/</span>.
A Javadoc comment takes the same form, but it begins with <span class="code">/**</span> rather than simply&nbsp;<span class="code">/*</span>.
You have already seen comments of this form in some of the examples in this book, such as
this subroutine from <a href="../c4/s3.html">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * This subroutine prints a 3N+1 sequence to standard output, using
 * startingValue as the initial value of N.  It also prints the number 
 * of terms in the sequence. The value of the parameter, startingValue, 
 * must  be a positive integer.
 */

static void print3NSequence(int startingValue) { ...</pre>
   

<p>Note that the Javadoc comment is placed just <b>before</b> the subroutine that
it is commenting on.  This rule is always followed.  You can have Javadoc
comments for subroutines, for member variables, and for classes.  The Javadoc
comment always immediately precedes the thing it is commenting on.</p>


<p>Like any comment, a Javadoc comment is ignored by the computer when the file is compiled.
But there is a tool called <span class="code">javadoc</span> that reads Java source code files, extracts
any Javadoc comments that it finds, and creates a set of Web pages containing the comments
in a nicely formatted, interlinked form.  By default, <span class="code">javadoc</span> will only collect
information about <span class="code">public</span> classes, subroutines, and member variables, but
it allows the option of creating documentation for non-public things as well.  If
<span class="code">javadoc</span> doesn't find any Javadoc comment for something, it will construct
one, but the comment will contain only basic information such as the name and type
of a member variable or the name, return type, and parameter list of a subroutine.
This is <b>syntactic</b> information.  To add information about semantics and pragmatics,
you have to write a Javadoc comment.</p>
   

<p>As an example, you can look at the documentation Web page for <span class="classname">TextIO</span> by
following this link: <a href="../TextIO_Javadoc/TextIO.html">TextIO&nbsp;Javadoc&nbsp;documentation</a>.
The documentation page was created by applying the <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool
to the source code file, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>.  If you have downloaded the on-line
version of this book, the documentation can be found in the <span class="code">TextIO_Javadoc</span>
directory.</p>


<p>In a Javadoc comment, the <span class="code">*</span>'s at the start of each line are optional.
The <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool will remove them.  In addition to normal text, the comment
can contain certain special codes.  For one thing, the comment can contain
<span class="newword">HTML mark-up</span> commands.  HTML is the language that is used to
create web pages, and Javadoc comments are meant to be shown on web pages.  The
<span class="code">javadoc</span> tool will copy any HTML commands in the comments to the web
pages that it creates.  You'll learn some basic HTML in <a href="../c6/s2.html">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>,
but as an example, you can add <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> to indicate the start of
a new paragraph.  (Generally, in the absence of HTML commands, blank lines and
extra spaces in the comment are ignored.)</p>
   

<p>In addition to HTML commands, Javadoc comments can include <span class="newword">doc tags</span>,
which are processed as commands by the <span class="code">javadoc</span> tool.  A doc tag has a
name that begins with the character&nbsp;<span class="code">@</span>.  I will only discuss three
tags:  <span class="code">@param</span>, <span class="code">@return</span>, and <span class="code">@throws</span>.
These tags are used in Javadoc comments for subroutines to provide information about its
parameters, its return value, and the <a href="../c4/s3.html#subroutines.3.5">exceptions</a>
that it might throw. These tags
are always placed at the end of the comment, after any description of the subroutine
itself.  The syntax for using them is:
</p>


<pre>@param  <span class="bnf">parameter-name</span>   <span class="bnf">description-of-parameter</span>
   
@return  <span class="bnf">description-of-return-value</span>
   
@throws  <span class="bnf">exception-class-name</span>   <span class="bnf">description-of-exception</span>
</pre>
   

<p>The <span class="bnf">descriptions</span> can extend over several lines.  The description ends at
the next tag or at the end of the comment.  You can include a <span class="code">@param</span> tag for
every parameter of the subroutine and a <span class="code">@throws</span> for as many types of exception
as you want to document.  You should have a <span class="code">@return</span> tag only for a
non-void subroutine.  These tags do not have to be given in any particular order.</p>


<p>Here is an example that doesn't do anything
exciting but that does use all three types of doc tag:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * This subroutine computes the area of a rectangle, given its width
 * and its height.  The length and the width should be positive numbers.
 * @param width the length of one side of the rectangle
 * @param height the length the second side of the rectangle
 * @return the area of the rectangle
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either the width or the height
 *    is a negative number.
 */
public static double areaOfRectangle( double length, double width ) {
    if ( width &lt; 0  ||  height &lt; 0 )
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sides must have positive length.");
    double area;
    area = width * height;
    return area; 
}</pre>
   

<p>I will use Javadoc comments for some of my examples.  I encourage you to use
them in your own code, even if you don't plan to generate Web page documentation
of your work, since it's a standard format that other Java programmers will be
familiar with.</p>


<p>If you do want to create Web-page documentation, you need to run the
<span class="code">javadoc</span> tool.  This tool is available as a command in the Java Development
Kit that was discussed in <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>.  You can use <span class="code">javadoc</span>
in a command line interface similarly to the way that the <span class="code">javac</span> and
<span class="code">java</span> commands are used.  Javadoc can also be applied in the
Eclipse integrated development environment that was also discussed in 
<a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>:  Just right-click the class or package that you
want to document in the Package Explorer, select "Export," and select "Javadoc"
in the window that pops up.  I won't go into any of the details here; see the
documentation.</p>
