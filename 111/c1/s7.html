<p>
<span class="start"><big>C</big>omputers can be connected</span> together on <span class="newword">networks</span>. 
A computer on a network can communicate with other
computers on the same network by exchanging data and files or by sending and
receiving messages. Computers on a network can even work together on a large
computation.</p>


<p>Today, millions of computers throughout the world are connected to a single
huge network called the <span class="newword">Internet</span>. New computers
are being connected to the Internet every day. Computers can join the
Internet by using a modem to establish a connection through telephone lines.
<span class="newword">Broadband connections</span> to the Internet, such as
DSL and cable modems, are increasingly common.  They allow faster data transmission 
than is possible through telephone modems.
</p>


<p>There are elaborate <span class="newword">protocols</span> for communication
over the Internet. A protocol is simply a detailed specification of how
communication is to proceed. For two computers to communicate at all, they must
both be using the same protocols. The most basic protocols on the Internet are
the <span class="newword">Internet Protocol</span> (IP), which specifies how
data is to be physically transmitted from one computer to another, and the
<span class="newword">Transmission Control Protocol</span> (TCP), which ensures
that data sent using IP is received in its entirety and without error. These
two protocols, which are referred to collectively as TCP/IP, provide a
foundation for communication. Other protocols use TCP/IP to send specific types
of information such as web pages, electronic mail, and data files.</p>


<p>All communication over the Internet is in the form of <span class="newword">packets</span>.
A packet consists of some data being sent from one
computer to another, along with addressing information that indicates where on
the Internet that data is supposed to go. Think of a packet as an envelope with
an address on the outside and a message on the inside. (The message is the
data.) The packet also includes a "return address," that is, the address of the
sender. A packet can hold only a limited amount of data; longer messages must
be divided among several packets, which are then sent individually over the net
and reassembled at their destination.</p>


<p>Every computer on the Internet has an <span class="newword">IP address</span>, 
a number that identifies it uniquely among all the computers on
the net. The IP address is used for addressing packets. A computer can only
send data to another computer on the Internet if it knows that computer's IP
address. Since people prefer to use names rather than numbers, most computers
are also identified by names, called <span class="newword">domain names</span>.
For example, the main computer of the Mathematics Department at Hobart and William Smith Colleges has the
domain name math.hws.edu. (Domain names are just for convenience; your computer
still needs to know IP addresses before it can communicate. There are computers
on the Internet whose job it is to translate domain names to IP addresses. When
you use a domain name, your computer sends a message to a domain name server to
find out the corresponding IP address. Then, your computer uses the IP address,
rather than the domain name, to communicate with the other computer.)</p>


<p>The Internet provides a number of services to the computers connected to it
(and, of course, to the users of those computers). These services use TCP/IP to
send various types of data over the net. Among the most popular services are
instant messaging, file sharing, electronic mail, and the World-Wide Web.
Each service has its own protocols, which are used to control transmission of
data over the network.  Each service also has some sort of user interface,
which allows the user to view, send, and receive data through the service.</p>


<p>For example, the email service uses a protocol known as <span class="newword">SMTP</span>
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to transfer email messages from one computer to another.
Other protocols, such as POP and IMAP, are used to fetch messages from an email
account so that the recipient can read them.  A person who uses email, however, 
doesn't need to understand or even know about these protocols.  Instead, they
are used behind the scenes by the programs that the person uses to send
and receive email messages.  These programs provide an easy-to-use user interface
to the underlying network protocols.</p>


<p>The World-Wide Web is perhaps the most exciting of network services.  The World-Wide Web
allows you to request <span class="newword">pages</span> of information that are stored on computers all over
the Internet.  A Web page can contain <span class="newword">links</span> to other pages on the
same computer from which it was obtained or to other computers anywhere in the world.
A computer that stores such pages of information is called a
<span class="newword">web server</span>.  The user interface to the Web is the type of
program known as a <span class="newword">web browser</span>.  Common web browsers include 
Internet Explorer and Firefox.  You use a Web browser to
request a page of information.  The browser will send a request for that page to
the computer on which the page is stored, and when a response is received from that
computer, the web browser displays it to you in a neatly formatted form.
A web browser is just a user interface to the Web.  Behind the scenes, the
web browser uses a protocol called <span class="newword">HTTP</span> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) 
to send each page request and to receive the response from the web server.
</p>

<p>Now just what, you might be thinking, does all this have to do with Java? In
fact, Java is intimately associated with the Internet and the World-Wide Web.
As you have seen in the previous section, special Java programs called applets
are meant to be transmitted over the Internet and displayed on Web pages. A Web
server transmits a Java applet just as it would transmit any other type of
information. A Web browser that understands Java -- that is, that includes an
interpreter for the Java virtual machine -- can then run the applet right on
the Web page. Since applets are programs, they can do almost anything,
including complex interaction with the user. With Java, a Web page becomes more
than just a passive display of information. It becomes anything that
programmers can imagine and implement.</p>


<p>But applets are only one aspect of Java's relationship with the Internet,
and not the major one.  In fact, as both Java and the Internet have matured, 
applets have become less important.  At the same time, however, Java has increasingly
been used to write complex, stand-alone applications that do not depend
on a web browser.  Many of these programs are network-related.  For example
many of the largest and most complex web sites use web server software
that is written in Java.  Java includes excellent support for network protocols,
and its platform independence makes it possible to write network programs
that work on many different types of computer.
</p>   


<p>Its association with the Internet is not Java's only advantage. But many good
programming languages have been invented only to be soon forgotten. Java has
had the good luck to ride on the coattails of the Internet's immense and increasing
popularity.</p>
