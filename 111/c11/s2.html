<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he data and programs</span> in a computer's main memory
survive only as long as the power is on. For more permanent storage, computers
use <span class="newword">files</span>, which are collections of data stored on
a hard disk, on a USB memory stick, on a CD-ROM, or on some other type of storage
device. Files are organized into <span class="newword">directories</span>
(sometimes called <span class="newword">folders</span>). A directory can hold other directories, as well
as files. Both directories and files have names that are used to identify
them.</p>


<p>Programs can read data from existing files. They can create new files and
can write data to files. In Java, such input and output can be done using streams.
Human-readable character data is read from a file using an object belonging to
the class <span class="classname">FileReader</span>, which is a subclass of <span class="classname">Reader</span>.
Similarly, data is written to a file in human-readable format through an object
of type <span class="classname">FileWriter</span>, a subclass of <span class="classname">Writer</span>. For files that
store data in machine format, the appropriate I/O classes are
<span class="classname">FileInputStream</span> and <span class="classname">FileOutputStream</span>. In this section, I will
only discuss character-oriented file I/O using the <span class="classname">FileReader</span> and
<span class="classname">FileWriter</span> classes. However, <span class="classname">FileInputStream</span> and
<span class="classname">FileOutputStream</span> are used in an exactly parallel fashion. All these
classes are defined in the <span class="code">java.io</span> package.</p>


<p>It's worth noting right at the start that applets which are downloaded over
a network connection are not allowed to access files (unless you have made a very
foolish change to your web browser's configuration). This is a
security consideration. You can download and run an applet just by visiting a
Web page with your browser. If downloaded applets had access to the files on
your computer, it would be easy to write an applet that would destroy all the
data on a computer that downloads it. To prevent such possibilities, there are
a number of things that downloaded applets are not allowed to do. Accessing
files is one of those forbidden things. Standalone programs written in Java,
however, have the same access to your files as any other program. When you
write a standalone Java application, you can use all the file operations
described in this section.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.2.1">11.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading and Writing Files</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="classname">FileReader</span> class has a constructor which takes the name of a
file as a parameter and creates an input stream that can be used for reading
from that file. This constructor will throw an exception of type
<span class="classname">FileNotFoundException</span> if the file doesn't exist.   It
requires mandatory exception handling, so you have to call the constructor in a
<span class="code">try..catch</span> statement (or inside a routine that is declared to throw
the exception). For example, suppose you have a file named
"<span class="code">data.txt</span>", and you want your program to read data from that file. You
could do the following to create an input stream for the file:</p>


<pre>FileReader data;   // (Declare the variable before the
                   //   try statement, or else the variable
                   //   is local to the try block and you won't
                   //   be able to use it later in the program.)
                        
try {
   data = new FileReader("data.txt");  // create the stream
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // do something to handle the error -- maybe, end the program
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="classname">FileNotFoundException</span> class is a subclass of
<span class="classname">IOException</span>, so it would be acceptable to catch <span class="classname">IOExceptions</span>
in the above <span class="code">try...catch</span> statement. More generally, just about any
error that can occur during input/output operations can be caught by a
<span class="code">catch</span> clause that handles <span class="classname">IOException</span>.</p>


<p>Once you have successfully created a <span class="classname">FileReader</span>, you can start
reading data from it. But since <span class="classname">FileReaders</span> have only the primitive
input methods inherited from the basic <span class="classname">Reader</span> class, you will probably
want to wrap your <span class="classname">FileReader</span> in a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, in
a <span class="classname">TextReader</span>, or in
some other wrapper class. (The <span class="classname">TextReader</span> class is not a standard part
of Java; it is described in <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.4</a>.
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> is discussed in <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.5">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.5</a>.) To
create a <span class="classname">TextReader</span> for reading from a file named <span class="code">data.dat</span>,
you could say:</p>


<pre>TextReader data;

try {
   data = new TextReader( new FileReader("data.dat") );
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>


<p>Once you have a <span class="classname">TextReader</span> named <span class="code">data</span>, you can read from
it using such methods as <span class="code">data.getInt()</span> and <span class="code">data.peek()</span>,
exactly as you would from any other <span class="classname">TextReader</span>.</p>


<p>Working with output files is no more difficult than this. You simply create
an object belonging to the class <span class="classname">FileWriter</span>. You will probably want to
wrap this output stream in an object of type <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>. For example,
suppose you want to write data to a file named "<span class="code">result.dat</span>". Since the
constructor for <span class="classname">FileWriter</span> can throw an exception of type
<span class="classname">IOException</span>, you should use a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement:</p>


<pre>PrintWriter result;

try {
   result = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("result.dat"));
}
catch (IOException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>


<p>If no file named <span class="code">result.dat</span> exists, a new file will be created. If
the file already exists, then the current contents of the file will be erased
and replaced with the data that your program writes to the file.   This will be
done without any warning.  To avoid overwriting a file that already exists, you
can check whether a file of the same name already exists before trying to create
the stream, as discussed later in this section.  An
<span class="classname">IOException</span> might occur in the <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>
constructor if, for example, you are trying to create a
file on a disk that is "write-protected," meaning that it cannot be modified.</p>


<p>After you are finished using a file, it's a good idea to <span class="newword">close</span> 
the file, to tell the operating system that you are
finished using it.  You can close a file by calling the <span class="code">close()</span> method of the
associated stream.  Once a file has been closed, it is no longer possible to
read data from it or write data to it, unless you open it again as a new
stream. (Note that for most stream classes, the <span class="code">close()</span> method can
throw an <span class="classname">IOException</span>, which must be handled; however, both
<span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> and <span class="classname">TextReader</span>
override this method so that it cannot throw such exceptions.)
If you forget to close a file, the file will ordinarily be
closed automatically when the program terminates or when the file object
is garbage collected, but in the case of an output file, some of the data that has 
been written to the file might be lost.  This can occur because data that
is written to a file can be <span class="newword">buffered</span>; that is, the data is not
sent immediately to the file but is retained in main memory (in a "buffer") until
a larger chunk of data is ready to be written.  This is done for efficiency.
The <span class="code">close()</span> method
of an output stream will cause all the data in the buffer to be sent to the file.
Every output stream also has a <span class="code">flush()</span> method that can be called
to force any data in the buffer to be written to the file without closing the file.</p>


<p>As a complete example, here is a program that will read numbers from a file
named <span class="code">data.dat</span>, and will then write out the same numbers in reverse
order to another file named <span class="code">result.dat</span>. It is assumed that
<span class="code">data.dat</span> contains only one number on each line. Exception-handling is used to check for
problems along the way. Although the application is not a particularly useful
one, this program demonstrates the basics of working with files. (By the way,
at the end of this program, you'll find our first useful example of a <span class="code">finally</span>
clause in a <span class="code">try</span> statement. When the computer executes a <span class="code">try</span>
statement, the commands in its <span class="code">finally</span> clause are guaranteed to be
executed, no matter what.)</p>

<a name="IO.2.2">11.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Files and Directories</a>
</h3>



<p>The subject of file names is actually more complicated than I've let on so
far. To fully specify a file, you have to give both the name of the file and
the name of the directory where that file is located. A simple file name like
"data.dat" or "result.dat" is taken to refer to a file in a directory that is
called the <span class="newword">current directory</span> (also known as the "default
directory" or "working directory"). The current directory is not a permanent
thing. It can be changed by the user or by a program. Files not in the current
directory must be referred to by a <span class="newword">path name</span>,
which includes both the name of the file and information about the directory
where it can be found.</p>


<p>To complicate matters even further, there are two types of path names,
<span class="newword">absolute path names</span> and <span class="newword">relative path names</span>. 
An absolute path name uniquely identifies
one file among all the files available to the computer. It contains full
information about which directory the file is in and what the file's name is. A
relative path name tells the computer how to locate the file starting from the
current directory.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the syntax for file names and path names varies somewhat
from one type of computer to another. Here are some examples:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">data.dat</span>  --  on any computer, this would be a file named "data.dat"
in the current directory.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">/home/eck/java/examples/data.dat</span>  --  This is an absolute path name
in a UNIX operating system, including Linux and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X. 
It refers to a file named data.dat in a directory
named examples, which is in turn in a directory named java,&nbsp;....</li>

<li>
<span class="code">C:\eck\java\examples\data.dat</span>  --  An absolute path name on a 
Windows computer.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">Hard Drive:java:examples:data.dat</span>  --  Assuming that "Hard Drive" is
the name of a disk drive, this would be an absolute path name on a computer
using a classic Macintosh operating system such as Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;9.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">examples/data.dat</span>  --  a relative path name under UNIX. "examples"
is the name of a directory that is contained within the current directory, and
data.dat is a file in that directory. The corresponding relative path name
for Windows would be <span class="code">examples\data.dat</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">../examples/data.dat</span>  --  a relative path name in UNIX that means "go to the
directory that contains the current directory, then go into a directory named examples
inside that directory, and look there for a file named data.data."  In general, "<span class="code">..</span>"
means "go up one directory."</li>

</ul>


<p>It's reasonably safe
to say, though, that if you stick to using simple file names only, and if the
files are stored in the same directory with the program that will use them,
then you will be OK.   Later in this section, we'll look at a convenient way of
letting the user specify a file in a GUI program, which allows you to avoid the issue of
path names altogether.</p>
   

<p>It is possible for a Java program to find out the absolute path names
for two important directories, the current directory and the user's home
directory.  The names of these directories are <span class="newword">system properties</span>,
and they can be read using the function calls:
</p>
   

<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">System.getProperty("user.dir")</span>  --  returns the
absolute path name of the current directory as a <span class="classname">String</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">System.getProperty("user.home")</span>  --  returns the
absolute path name of the user's home directory as a <span class="classname">String</span>.</li>

</ul>


<p>To avoid some of the problems caused by differences in path names between platforms, Java
has the class <span class="code">java.io.File</span>. An object belonging to this class
represents a file. More precisely, an object of type <span class="classname">File</span> represents a
file <b>name</b> rather than a file as such. The file to which the name
refers might or might not exist. Directories are treated in the same way as
files, so a <span class="classname">File</span> object can represent a directory just as easily as it
can represent a file.</p>


<p>A <span class="classname">File</span> object has a constructor, <span class="code">new</span> <span class="code">File(String)</span>,
that creates a <span class="classname">File</span> object from a path name. The name can be a simple
name, a relative path, or an absolute path. For example, <span class="code">new</span>
<span class="code">File("data.dat")</span> creates a <span class="classname">File</span> object that refers to a file
named data.dat, in the current directory. Another constructor, <span class="code">new</span>
<span class="code">File(File,String)</span>, has two parameters. The first is a <span class="classname">File</span>
object that refers to the directory that contains the file. The second can be the
name of the file or a relative path from the directory to the file.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">File</span> objects contain several useful instance methods. Assuming that
<span class="code">file</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">File</span>, here are some of the methods
that are available:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">file.exists()</span>  --  This
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the file named by the
<span class="classname">File</span> object already exists. You can use this method if you want to
avoid overwriting the contents of an existing file when you create a new
<span class="classname">FileWriter</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.isDirectory()</span>  --  This
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the <span class="classname">File</span>
object refers to a directory. It returns <span class="code">false</span> if it refers to a
regular file or if no file with the given name exists.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.delete()</span>  --  Deletes the file, if
it exists.  Returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value to indicate whether
the file was successfully deleted.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.list()</span>  --  If the <span class="code">File</span>
object refers to a directory, this function returns an array of type
<span class="code">String[]</span> containing the names of the files in that directory.
Otherwise, it returns <span class="code">null</span>.</li>

</ul>
   

<p>Here, for example, is a program that will list the names of all the files in
a directory specified by the user.  Just for fun, I have used a
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> (<a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.5">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.5</a>)
to read the user's input:</p>


<pre>import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This program lists the files in a directory specified by
 * the user.  The user is asked to type in a directory name.
 * If the name entered by the user is not a directory, a
 * message is printed and the program ends.
 */
public class DirectoryList {

   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      String directoryName;  // Directory name entered by the user.
      File directory;        // File object referring to the directory.
      String[] files;        // Array of file names in the directory.
      Scanner scanner;       // For reading a line of input from the user.

      scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  // scanner reads from standard input.

      System.out.print("Enter a directory name: ");
      directoryName = scanner.nextLine().trim();
      directory = new File(directoryName);
      
      if (directory.isDirectory() == false) {
          if (directory.exists() == false)
             System.out.println("There is no such directory!");
          else
             System.out.println("That file is not a directory.");
      }
      else {
          files = directory.list();
          System.out.println("Files in directory \"" + directory + "\":");
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++)
             System.out.println("   " + files[i]);
      }
   
   } // end main()

} // end class DirectoryList</pre>


<p>All the classes that are used for reading data from files and writing data
to files have constructors that take a <span class="classname">File</span> object as a parameter. For
example, if <span class="code">file</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">File</span>, and you want to
read character data from that file, you can create a <span class="classname">FileReader</span> to do
so by saying <span class="code">new</span> <span class="code">FileReader(file)</span>. If you want to use a
<span class="classname">TextReader</span> to read from the file, you could say:</p>


<pre>TextReader data;
 
try {
   data = new TextReader( new FileReader(file) );
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>



   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.2.3">11.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File Dialog Boxes</a>
</h3>
   


<p>In many programs, you want the user to be able to select the file that is
going to be used for input or output. If your program lets the user type in the
file name, you will just have to assume that the user understands how to work
with files and directories. But in a graphical user interface, the user expects
to be able to select files using a <span class="newword">file dialog box</span>, 
which is a window that a program can open when it wants the
user to select a file for input or output. Swing includes a
platform-independent technique for using file dialog boxes in the form of a
class called <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span>. This class is part of the package
<span class="code">javax.swing</span>. We looked at using some basic dialog boxes in 
<a href="../c6/s8.html#GUI1.8.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.8.2</a>. File dialog boxes are similar to those, but
are a little more complicated to use.</p>


<p>A file dialog box shows the user a list of files and sub-directories in some
directory, and makes it easy for the user to specify a file in that directory.
The user can also navigate easily from one directory to another. The most
common constructor for <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span> has no parameter
and sets the starting directory in the dialog box to be the user's home directory.
There are also constructors that specify the starting directory explicitly:
</p>


<pre>new JFileChooser( File startDirectory )

new JFileChooser( String pathToStartDirectory )</pre>
   

<p>Constructing a <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span> object does not make the dialog box
appear on the screen. You have to call a method in the object to do that.
There are two different methods that can be used because there are two types of
file dialog: An <span class="newword">open file dialog</span> allows the user
to specify an existing file to be opened for reading data into the program; a
<span class="newword">save file dialog</span> lets the user specify a file,
which might or might not already exist, to be opened for writing data from the
program. File dialogs of these two types are opened using the
<span class="code">showOpenDialog</span> and <span class="code">showSaveDialog</span> methods.
These methods make the dialog box appear on the screen; the methods do
not end until the user selects a file or cancels the dialog.</p>


<p>A file dialog box always has a <span class="newword">parent</span>, another
component which is associated with the dialog box. The parent is specified as a
parameter to the <span class="code">showOpenDialog</span> or <span class="code">showSaveDialog</span> methods.
The parent is a GUI component, and can often be specified as "<span class="code">this</span>" in
practice, since file dialogs are often used in instance methods of GUI component classes.
(The parameter can also be <span class="code">null</span>, in which case an invisible component is
created to be used as the parent.) Both <span class="code">showOpenDialog</span> and <span class="code">showSaveDialog</span>
have a return value, which will be one of the constants
<span class="code">JFileChooser.CANCEL_OPTION</span>, <span class="code">JFileChooser.ERROR_OPTION</span>, or
<span class="code">JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION</span>. If the return value is
<span class="code">JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION</span>, then the user has selected a file. If the
return value is something else, then the user did not select a file. The user
might have clicked a "Cancel" button, for example. You should always check the
return value, to make sure that the user has, in fact, selected a file. If that
is the case, then you can find out which file was selected by calling the
<span class="classname">JFileChooser's</span> <span class="code">getSelectedFile()</span> method, which returns an object of
type <span class="classname">File</span> that represents the selected file.</p>


<p>Putting all this together, we can look at a typical subroutine that reads
data from a file that is selected using a <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span>:</p>


<pre>public void readFile() {
   if (fileDialog == null)   // (fileDialog is an instance variable)
      fileDialog = new JFileChooser();
   fileDialog.setDialogTitle("Select File for Reading");
   fileDialog.setSelectedFile(null);  // No file is initially selected.
   int option = fileDialog.showOpenDialog(this);
       // (Using "this" as a parameter to showOpenDialog() assumes that the
       //  readFile() method is an instance method in a GUI component class.)
   if (option != JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION)
      return;  // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box.
   File selectedFile = fileDialog.getSelectedFile();
   TextReader in;  // (or use some other wrapper class)
   try {
      FileReader stream = new FileReader(selectedFile); // (or a FileInputStream)
      in = new TextReader( stream );
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,
          "Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to open the file:\n" + e);
      return;
   }
   try {
      .
      .  // Read and process the data from the input stream, in.
      .
     in.close();
   }

      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,
          "Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to read the data:\n" + e);
   }

<p>One fine point here is that the variable <span class="code">fileDialog</span> is an instance
variable of type <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span>.  This allows the
file dialog to continue to exist between calls to <span class="code">readFile()</span>.
The main effect of this is that the dialog box will keep the same selected
directory from one call of <span class="code">readFile()</span> to the next.  When the
dialog reappears, it will show the same directory that the user selected
the previous time it appeared.  This is probably what the user expects.</p>
   

<p>Note that it's common to do some configuration of a <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span> before
calling <span class="code">showOpenDialog</span> or <span class="code">showSaveDialog</span>. For example, the
instance method <span class="code">setDialogTitle(String)</span> is used to specify a title
to appear in the title bar of the window. And <span class="code">setSelectedFile(File)</span> is
used to set the file that is selected in the dialog box when it appears. This
can be used to provide a default file choice for the user.  In the <span class="code">readFile()</span>
method, above, <span class="code">fileDialog.setSelectedFile(null)</span> specifies that
no file is pre-selected when the dialog box appears.</p>


<p>Writing data to a file is similar, but it's a good idea to add a check
to determine whether the output file that is selected by the user already
exists.  In that case, ask the user whether to replace the file.
Here is a typical subroutine for writing to a user-selected file:</p>


<pre>public void writeFile() {
   if (fileDialog == null)      
      fileDialog = new JFileChooser();  // (fileDialog is an instance variable)
   File selectedFile = new File("(default file name)");
   fileDialog.setSelectedFile(selectedFile);  // Specify a default file name.
   fileDialog.setDialogTitle("Select File for Writing");
   int option = fileDialog.showSaveDialog(this);
   if (option != JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION)
      return;  // User canceled or clicked the dialog's close box.
   selectedFile = fileDialog.getSelectedFile();
   if (selectedFile.exists()) {  // Ask the user whether to replace the file.
      int response = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog( this,
            "The file \"" + selectedFile.getName()
                + "\" already exists.\nDo you want to replace it?", 
            "Confirm Save",
            JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION, 
            JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE );
      if (response != JOptionPane.YES_OPTION)
         return;  // User does not want to replace the file.
   }
   PrintWriter out;  // (or use some other wrapper class)
   try {
      FileWriter stream = new FileWriter(selectedFile); // (or FileOutputStream)
      out = new PrintWriter( stream );
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,
          "Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to open the file:\n" + e);
      return;
   }
   try {
      .
      .  // Write data to the output stream, out.
      .
     out.close();
     if (out.checkError())   // (need to check for errors in PrintWriter)
        throw new IOException("Error check failed.");
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,
          "Sorry, but an error occurred while trying to write the data:\n" + e);
   }	
}</pre>



<p>The <span class="code">readFile()</span> and <span class="code">writeFile()</span> routines
presented here can be used, with just a few changes, when you need to read
or write a file in a GUI program.
We'll look at some more complete examples of using files and file dialogs in
the <a href="../c11/s3.html">next section</a>.</p>
