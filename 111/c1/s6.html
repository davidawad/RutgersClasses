<span class="start"><big>W</big>hen computers were first introduced</span>, ordinary
people -- including most programmers -- couldn't get near them. They were
locked up in rooms with white-coated attendants who would take your programs
and data, feed them to the computer, and return the computer's response some
time later. When timesharing -- where the computer switches its attention
rapidly from one person to another -- was invented in the 1960s, it became
possible for several people to interact directly with the computer at the same
time. On a timesharing system, users sit at "terminals" where they type
commands to the computer, and the computer types back its response. Early
personal computers also used typed commands and responses, except that there
was only one person involved at a time. This type of interaction between a user
and a computer is called a <span class="newword">command-line interface</span>.</p>


<p>Today, of course, most people interact with computers in a completely
different way. They use a <span class="newword">Graphical User Interface</span>, 
or GUI. The computer draws interface <span class="newword">components</span> on the
screen. The components include things like windows, scroll bars, menus,
buttons, and icons. Usually, a <span class="newword">mouse</span> is used to
manipulate such components. Assuming that you have not just been teleported in
from the 1970s, you are no doubt already familiar with the basics of graphical user
interfaces!</p>


<p>A lot of GUI interface components have become fairly standard. That is, they
have similar appearance and behavior on many different computer platforms
including Macintosh, Windows, and Linux. Java programs,
which are supposed to run on many different platforms without modification to
the program, can use all the standard GUI components. They might vary a little in
appearance from platform to platform, but their functionality should be
identical on any computer on which the program runs.</p>


<p>Below is a very simple Java program -- actually an "<span class="newword">applet</span>,"
since it is running right here in the middle of a
page -- that shows a few standard GUI interface components.

There are four
components that the user can interact with: a button, a checkbox, a text field, and
a pop-up menu. These components are labeled. There are a few other components
in the applet. The labels themselves are components (even though you can't
interact with them). The right half of the applet is a text area component,
which can display multiple lines of text, and a scrollbar component appears
alongside the text area when the number of lines of text becomes larger
than will fit in the text area.  And in fact, in Java terminology, the
whole applet is itself considered to be a "component." Try clicking on the
button and on the checkbox, and try selecting an item from the pop-up menu. You
will see a message in the text area about each action that you perform. You can
type in the text field, but you might have to click on it first to activate it.
When you press return while typing in the text field, you will see a message in
the text area:</p>

<div align="center">
<p>
<b>Java is not enabled in your browser,<br>but here is an image of the applet:</b>
</p>
<img src="GUIDemo.png"></div>
</applet></p>


<p>Now, Java actually has two complete sets of GUI components. One of these,
the AWT or <span class="newword">Abstract Windowing Toolkit</span>, was
available in the original version of Java. The other, which is known as
<span class="newword">Swing</span>, is included in Java version 1.2 or later,
and is used in preference to the AWT in most modern Java programs.  The
applet that is shown above uses components that are part of Swing. 
If your Web browser uses an old version of Java, you
might get an error when the browser tries to load the applet.  Remember
that most of the applets in this textbook require Java 5.0 (or higher).</p>


<p>When a user interacts with the GUI components in this applet, an
"event" is generated.  For example, clicking a push button generates an event, and pressing
return while typing in a text field generates an event.
Each time an
event is generated, a message is sent to the applet telling it that the event
has occurred, and the applet responds according to its program. In fact, the
program consists mainly of "event handlers" that tell the applet how to respond
to various types of events. In this example, the applet has been programmed
to respond to each event by displaying a message in the text area.</p>


<p>The use of the term "message" here is deliberate. Messages, as you saw in
the <a href="../c1/s5.html">previous&nbsp;section</a>, are sent to objects. In fact, Java
GUI components are implemented as objects. Java includes many predefined
classes that represent various types of GUI components. Some of these classes
are subclasses of others. Here is a diagram showing some of Swing's GUI classes
and their relationships:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="overview_fig5.png" width="522" height="240" alt="" class="bordered"></p>


<p>Don't worry about the details for now, but try to get some feel about how
object-oriented programming and inheritance are used here. Note that all the
GUI classes are subclasses, directly or indirectly, of a class called
<span class="classname">JComponent</span>, which represents general properties
that are shared by all Swing components.
Two of the direct subclasses of <span class="classname">JComponent</span>
themselves have subclasses. The classes <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> and
<span class="classname">JTextField</span>, which have certain behaviors in common, are grouped
together as subclasses of <span class="classname">JTextComponent</span>.
Similarly <span class="classname">JButton</span> and <span class="classname">JToggleButton</span>
are subclasses of <span class="classname">JAbstractButton</span>, which represents
properties common to both buttons and checkboxes.  (<span class="classname">JComboBox</span>,
by the way, is the Swing class that represents pop-up menus.)
</p>


<p>Just from this brief discussion, perhaps you can see how GUI programming can
make effective use of object-oriented design. In fact, GUI's, with their
"visible objects," are probably a major factor contributing to the popularity
of OOP.</p>


<p>Programming with GUI components and events is one of the most interesting
aspects of Java. However, we will spend several chapters on the basics before
returning to this topic in <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.</p>
