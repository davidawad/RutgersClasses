<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 6.7</h2>

           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.7:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a> involved a class, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>,
that could compute some statistics
of a set of numbers. Write a program that uses the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to
compute and display statistics of numbers entered by the user. The panel will
have an instance variable of type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that does the computations.
The panel should include a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> where the user enters a number.
It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that
have been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard
deviation. Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on
the labels should change. The user enters a number by typing it into the
<span class="classname">JTextField</span> and pressing return. There should be a "Clear" button that
clears out all the data. This means creating a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and
resetting the displays on the labels. My panel also has an "Enter" button that
does the same thing as pressing the return key in the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
(Recall that a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> generates an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span> when the
user presses return, so your panel should register itself to listen for
<span class="classname">ActionEvents</span> from the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.)
Write your program as a stand-alone application.  Here is an applet version of my solution to
this problem:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="StatsApplet.class" width="320" height="218" archive="Stats.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">

</div>
<hr>

<p>In my solution, I used four labels to display results and another label at the
top of the applet to display a message to the user. Aside from these labels,
one row of the applet holds three other components: a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and
two <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. The content pane of the applet, which holds all the
components, uses a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with six rows. Five of the rows hold
<span class="classname">JLabels</span>. The other row contains a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that holds the
<span class="classname">JTextField</span> and <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. This <span class="classname">JPanel</span> uses a
<span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with three columns and just one row.</p>


<p>The constructor that creates and lays out the
components. Since I want the program to look nice, I set a background color and
a foreground color for most of the components. I set the labels to
be opaque, to make sure that the background of each label will actually be
filled in with the label's background color. After looking at my first attempt,
I decided to use a Monospaced font for the display labels. In a Monospaced
font, all the characters are the same size. This makes it possible to line up
the output values vertically by putting the same number of characters in each
label. To make it easy to play with the colors and fonts, I declared three
named constants</p>


<pre>final static Color labelBG = new Color(240,225,200);  // beige
final static Color labelFG = new Color(180,0,0);  // dark red
final static Font labelFont = new Font("Monospaced", Font.PLAIN, 12);</pre>


<p>I could then make one of the labels, such as <span class="code">countLabel</span>, with the
commands:</p>


<pre>countLabel = new JLabel("Number of Entries:   0");
countLabel.setBackground(labelBG);
countLabel.setForeground(labelFG);
countLabel.setOpaque(true);
countLabel.setFont(labelFont);</pre>


<p>However, since there are four labels to create, I wrote a subroutine to
create a display label to show a given string:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A utility routine for creating the labels that are used
 * for display.  This routine is called by the constructor.
 * @param text The text to show on the label.
 */
private JLabel makeLabel(String text) {
   JLabel label = new JLabel(text);
   label.setBackground(labelBG);
   label.setForeground(labelFG);
   labe.setOpaque(true);
   label.setFont(labelFont);
   return label;
}</pre>


<p>Then in the constructor, the labels can be created with four
lines, instead of 16:</p>


<pre>countLabel =   makeLabel(" Number of Entries:  0");
sumLabel =     makeLabel(" Sum:                0.0");
meanLabel =    makeLabel(" Average:            undefined");
standevLabel = makeLabel(" Standard Deviation: undefined");</pre>


<p>Utility routines like <span class="code">makeLabel()</span> are very commonly used when there
are a lot of similar components to create. Note that when the labels are first
created, the text on the labels is appropriate for a dataset that contains zero
elements. In particular, if there are no data, the average and standard
deviation are undefined.</p>


<p>The panel registers itself to listen for action events from the
<span class="classname">JTextField</span> and from the <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. In the
<span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method, the function <span class="code">evt.getSource()</span> is
called to find the <span class="classname">Object</span> that generated the event. This will be
either the <span class="code">numberInput</span> box, the <span class="code">enterButton</span>, or the
<span class="code">clearButton</span>. The source of the event is checked to decide how to
respond. (This is an alternative to checking the event's action command.)</p>


<p>If the user clicked the "Clear" button, the response is to create a new
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and to reset the display labels to reflect the fact
that there is no data in the dataset. It's important to understand the effect
of the command "<span class="code">stats = new StatCalc();</span>". The panel will continue to
use the same <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>variable</b>, <span class="code">stats</span>. However, now
the variable refers to a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>object</b>. The new object
does not yet have any data in its dataset. The next time the user enters a
number, the dataset will get its first value. Always keep in mind the
difference between variables and objects. Also, keep in mind that you have to
think in terms of changing the state of the panel in response to events. I
change the panel's state by starting to use a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object,
and the display labels are changed to keep them consistent with the new
state.</p>


<p>When the user clicks the "Enter" button or presses return in the
<span class="classname">JTextField</span>, we have to get the user's input and add it to the
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object. This will cause the values of the four statistics to
change. We have to change the display labels to show the new values. The code
for getting the user's number from the input box includes a check to make sure that the user's
input is a legal number. If the input is not legal, then I show an error
message in the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> named <span class="code">message</span> and return from the
<span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method without entering any new data:</p>


<pre>double num;  // The user's number.
try {
   num = Double.parseDouble(numberInput.getText());
}
catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       // The user's entry is not a legal number.  
       // Put an error message in the message label
       // and return without entering a number.
   message.setText("\"" + numberInput.getText() + 
                       "\" is not a legal number.");
   numberInput.selectAll();
   numberInput.requestFocus();
   return;
}</pre>


<p>The commands "<span class="code">numberInput.selectAll();</span>" and
"<span class="code">numberInput.requestFocus();</span>" are there as a convenience for the user.
The first command, which was not covered in this chapter,
selects all the text in the number input box. The second
command gives the input focus to the input box. That way, the user can just
start typing the next number, without having to click on the input box or erase
the content of the box. (Since the contents of the box are selected, they will
disappear automatically when the user starts typing, to be replaced with the
new input. A surprising number of people have never learned that text
selections work this way.)</p>


<p>Once we have the user's number, the command "<span class="code">stats.enter(num);</span>"
adds the number <span class="code">num</span> into the dataset. The statistics about the data
set can be obtained by calling the functions <span class="code">stats.getCount()</span>,
<span class="code">stats.getSum()</span>, <span class="code">stats.getMean()</span>, and
<span class="code">stats.getStandardDeviation()</span>. This information can be found by reading
the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/StatCalc.java">source code</a></span> for the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>
class.</p>
   

<p>In addition to the StatCalc class and the panel class shown below, you will need a main routine before
you can run the program.  As usual, this can go in a separate class, such as:</p>
   

<pre>import javax.swing.JFrame;

/**
 * A stand-alone application that let's the user input some numbers and
 * compute some statistics The main program just opens a window
 * that shows a StatsPanel, which does all the work.
 */
public class Stats {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JFrame window = new JFrame("Simple Stats Calculator");
      StatsPanel content = new StatsPanel();
      window.setContentPane(content);
      window.pack();  // Set to preferred size of contents
      window.setLocation(100,100);
      window.setDefaultCloseOperation( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE );
      window.setVisible(true);
   }
   
}</pre>
