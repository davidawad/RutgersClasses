<p>
<span class="start"><big>O</big>bject-oriented programming</span> (OOP) represents an
attempt to make programs more closely model the way people think about and deal
with the world. In the older styles of programming, a programmer who is faced
with some problem must identify a computing task that needs to be performed in
order to solve the problem. Programming then consists of finding a sequence of
instructions that will accomplish that task. But at the heart of
object-oriented programming, instead of tasks we find objects -- entities that
have behaviors, that hold information, and that can interact with one another.
Programming consists of designing a set of objects that somehow model the
problem at hand. Software objects in the program can represent real or abstract
entities in the problem domain. This is supposed to make the design of the
program more natural and hence easier to get right and easier to
understand.</p>


<p>To some extent, OOP is just a change in point of view. We can think of an
object in standard programming terms as nothing more than a set of variables
together with some subroutines for manipulating those variables. In fact, it is
possible to use object-oriented techniques in any programming language.
However, there is a big difference between a language that makes OOP possible
and one that actively supports it. An object-oriented programming language such
as Java includes a number of features that make it very different from a
standard language. In order to make effective use of those features, you have
to "orient" your thinking correctly.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.1.1">5.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects, Classes, and Instances</a>
</h3>


<p>Objects are closely related to classes. We have already been working with
classes for several chapters, and we have seen that a class can contain
variables and subroutines. If an object is also a collection of variables and
subroutines, how do they differ from classes? And why does it require a
different type of thinking to understand and use them effectively? In the one
section where we worked with objects rather than classes, 
<a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>, it didn't seem to make much difference: We
just left the word "<span class="code">static</span>" out of the subroutine definitions!</p>


<p>I have said that classes "describe" objects, or more exactly that the
non-static portions of classes describe objects. But it's probably not very
clear what this means. The more usual terminology is to say that objects
<span class="newword">belong to</span> classes, but this might not be much
clearer. (There is a real shortage of English words to properly distinguish all
the concepts involved. An object certainly doesn't "belong" to a class in the
same way that a member variable "belongs" to a class.) From the point of view
of programming, it is more exact to say that classes are used to create
objects. A class is a kind of factory for constructing objects. The non-static
parts of the class specify, or describe, what variables and subroutines the
objects will contain. This is part of the explanation of how objects differ
from classes: Objects are created and destroyed as the program runs, and there
can be many objects with the same structure, if they are created using the same
class.</p>


<p>Consider a simple class whose job is to group together a few static member
variables. For example, the following class could be used to store information
about the person who is using the program:</p>


<pre>class UserData {
    static String name;
    static int age;
}</pre>


<p>In a program that uses this class, there is only one copy of each of the
variables <span class="code">UserData.name</span> and <span class="code">UserData.age</span>. There can only be
one "user," since we only have memory space to store data about one user. The
class, <span class="code">UserData</span>, and the variables it contains exist as long as the
program runs. Now, consider a similar class that includes non-static
variables:</p>


<pre>class PlayerData {
   String name;
   int age;
}</pre>


<p>In this case, there is no such variable as <span class="code">PlayerData.name</span> or
<span class="code">PlayerData.age</span>, since <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">age</span> are not static
members of <span class="code">PlayerData</span>. So, there is nothing much in the class at all -- except
the potential to create objects. But, it's a lot of potential, since
it can be used to create any number of objects! Each object will have its
<b>own</b> variables called <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">age</span>. There can
be many "players" because we can make new objects to represent new players on
demand. A program might use this class to store information about multiple
players in a game. Each player has a name and an age. When a player joins the
game, a new <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object can be created to represent that player.
If a player leaves the game, the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object that represents
that player can be destroyed. A system of objects in the program is being used
to dynamically model what is happening in the game. You can't do this with
"static" variables!</p>


<p>In <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>, we worked with applets, which
are objects. The reason they didn't seem to be any different from classes is
because we were only working with one applet in each class that we looked at.
But one class can be used to make many applets. Think of an applet that scrolls
a message across a Web page. There could be several such applets on the same
page, all created from the same class. If the scrolling message in the applet
is stored in a non-static variable, then each applet will have its own
variable, and each applet can show a different message. The situation is even
clearer if you think about windows, which, like applets, are objects. As a
program runs, many windows might be opened and closed, but all those windows
can belong to the same class. Here again, we have a dynamic situation where
multiple objects are created and destroyed as a program runs.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>An object that belongs to a class is said to be an <span class="newword">instance</span> 
of that class. The variables that the object contains
are called <span class="newword">instance variables</span>. The subroutines
that the object contains are called <span class="newword">instance methods</span>. 
(Recall that in the context of object-oriented programming,
<span class="newword">method</span> is a synonym for "subroutine". From now on, since we are doing
object-oriented programming, I will prefer the term "method.") For example, if the
<span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, as defined above, is used to create an object, then
that object is an instance of the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, and <span class="code">name</span>
and <span class="code">age</span> are instance variables in the object. It is important to
remember that the class of an object determines the <b>types</b> of
the instance variables; however, the actual data is contained inside the
individual objects, not the class. Thus, each object has its own set of
data.</p>


<p>An applet that scrolls a message across a Web page might include a
subroutine named <span class="code">scroll()</span>. Since the applet is an object, this
subroutine is an instance method of the applet. The source code for the method
is in the class that is used to create the applet. Still, it's better to think
of the instance method as belonging to the object, not to the class. The
non-static subroutines in the class merely specify the instance methods that
every object created from the class will contain. The <span class="code">scroll()</span> methods
in two different applets do the same thing in the sense that they both scroll
messages across the screen. But there is a real difference between the two
<span class="code">scroll()</span> methods. The messages that they scroll can be different. You
might say that the method definition in the class specifies what type of
behavior the objects will have, but the specific behavior can vary from object
to object, depending on the values of their instance variables.</p>


<p>As you can see, the static and the non-static portions of a class are very
different things and serve very different purposes. Many classes contain only
static members, or only non-static. However, it is possible to mix static and
non-static members in a single class, and we'll see a few examples later in
this chapter where it is reasonable to do so.  You should distinguish between
the <b>source code</b> for the class, and the <b>class itself</b>.  The
source code determines both the class and the objects that are created from
that class.  The "static" definitions in the source code specify the things
that are part of the class itself, whereas the non-static definitions in the
source code specify things that will become part of every instance object
that is created from the class.   By the way, static member
variables and static member subroutines in a class are sometimes called
<span class="newword">class variables</span> and <span class="newword">class methods</span>, 
since they belong to the class itself, rather than to instances
of that class.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.1.2">5.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentals of Objects</a>
</h3>
   

<p>So far, I've been talking mostly in generalities, and I haven't given you
much idea what you have to put in a program if you want to work with objects.
Let's look at a specific example to see how it works. Consider this extremely
simplified version of a <span class="code">Student</span> class, which could be used to store
information about students taking a course:</p>


<pre>public class Student {

   public String name;  // Student's name.
   public double test1, test2, test3;   // Grades on three tests.
   
   public double getAverage() {  // compute average test grade
      return (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3;
   }
   
}  // end of class Student</pre>


<p>None of the members of this class are declared to be <span class="code">static</span>, so the
class exists only for creating objects. This class definition says that any
object that is an instance of the <span class="code">Student</span> class will include instance
variables named <span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and
<span class="code">test3</span>, and it will include an instance method named
<span class="code">getAverage()</span>. The names and tests in different objects will generally
have different values. When called for a particular student, the method
<span class="code">getAverage()</span> will compute an average using <b>that
student's</b> test grades. Different students can have different averages.
(Again, this is what it means to say that an instance method belongs to an
individual object, not to the class.)</p>


<p>In Java, a class is a <b>type</b>, similar to the built-in types
such as <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>. So, a class name can be used to
specify the type of a variable in a declaration statement, the type of a formal
parameter, or the return type of a function. For example, a program could
define a variable named <span class="code">std</span> of type <span class="code">Student</span> with the
statement</p>


<pre>Student std;</pre>


<p>However, declaring a variable does <b>not</b> create an object!
This is an important point, which is related to this Very Important Fact:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>In Java, no variable can ever hold an object.<br>
A variable can only hold a reference to an object.</b>
</p>
</div>


<p>You should think of objects as floating around independently in the
computer's memory. In fact, there is a special portion of memory called the
<span class="newword">heap</span> where objects live. Instead of holding an
object itself, a variable holds the information necessary to find the object in
memory. This information is called a <span class="newword">reference</span> or
<span class="newword">pointer</span> to the object. In effect, a reference to
an object is the address of the memory location where the object is stored.
When you use a variable of class type, the computer uses the reference in the
variable to find the actual object.</p>


<p>In a program, objects are created using an operator called <span class="code">new</span>, which
creates an object and returns a reference to that object. For example, assuming
that <span class="code">std</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>, declared as above,
the assignment statement</p>


<pre>std = new Student();</pre>


<p>would create a new object which is an instance of the class
<span class="code">Student</span>, and it would store a reference to that object in the variable
<span class="code">std</span>. The value of the variable is a reference to the object, not the
object itself. It is not quite true, then, to say that the object is the "value
of the variable <span class="code">std</span>" (though sometimes it is hard to avoid using this
terminology). It is certainly <b>not at all true</b> to say that the
object is "stored in the variable <span class="code">std</span>." The proper terminology is that
"the variable <span class="code">std</span> <span class="newword">refers to</span> the object,"
and I will try to stick to that terminology as much as possible.</p>


<p>So, suppose that the variable <span class="code">std</span> refers to an object belonging to
the class <span class="code">Student</span>. That object has instance variables <span class="code">name</span>,
<span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and <span class="code">test3</span>. These instance variables
can be referred to as <span class="code">std.name</span>, <span class="code">std.test1</span>,
<span class="code">std.test2</span>, and <span class="code">std.test3</span>. This follows the usual naming
convention that when <span class="code">B</span> is part of <span class="code">A</span>, then the full name of
<span class="code">B</span> is <span class="code">A.B</span>. For example, a program might include the lines</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Hello, "  +  std.name  +  ".  Your test grades are:");
System.out.println(std.test1);
System.out.println(std.test2);
System.out.println(std.test3);</pre>


<p>This would output the name and test grades from the object to which
<span class="code">std</span> refers. Similarly, <span class="code">std</span> can be used to call the
<span class="code">getAverage()</span> instance method in the object by saying
<span class="code">std.getAverage()</span>. To print out the student's average, you could
say:</p>


<pre>System.out.println( "Your average is "  +  std.getAverage() );</pre>


<p>More generally, you could use <span class="code">std.name</span> any place where a variable
of type <span class="classname">String</span> is legal. You can use it in expressions. You can assign
a value to it. You can even use it to call subroutines from the <span class="classname">String</span>
class. For example, <span class="code">std.name.length()</span> is the number of characters in
the student's name.</p>


<p>It is possible for a variable like <span class="code">std</span>, whose type is given by a
class, to refer to no object at all. We say in this case that <span class="code">std</span>
holds a <span class="newword">null reference</span>. The null reference is
written in Java as "<span class="code">null</span>". You can store a null reference in the
variable <span class="code">std</span> by saying</p>


<pre>std = null;</pre>


<p>and you could test whether the value of <span class="code">std</span> is null by testing</p>


<pre>if (std == null) . . .</pre>


<p>If the value of a variable is <span class="code">null</span>, then it is, of course, illegal
to refer to instance variables or instance methods through that variable -- since
there is no object, and hence no instance variables to refer to. For
example, if the value of the variable <span class="code">std</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then it
would be illegal to refer to <span class="code">std.test1</span>. If your program attempts to
use a null reference illegally like this, the result is an error called a
<span class="newword">null pointer exception</span>.</p>


<p>Let's look at a sequence of statements that work with objects:</p>


<pre>Student std, std1,       // Declare four variables of
          std2, std3;    //   type Student.
std = new Student();     // Create a new object belonging
                         //   to the class Student, and
                         //   store a reference to that
                         //   object in the variable std.
std1 = new Student();    // Create a second Student object
                         //   and store a reference to
                         //   it in the variable std1.
std2 = std1;             // Copy the reference value in std1
                         //   into the variable std2.
std3 = null;             // Store a null reference in the
                         //   variable std3.
                         
std.name = "John Smith";  // Set values of some instance variables.
std1.name = "Mary Jones";

     // (Other instance variables have default
     //    initial values of zero.)</pre>


<p>After the computer executes these statements, the situation in the
computer's memory looks like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="objectsInHeap.png" width="471" height="359" alt="(Objects and variables created by above code)" class="bordered"></p>



<p>This picture shows variables as little boxes, labeled with the names of the
variables. Objects are shown as boxes with round corners. When a variable
contains a reference to an object, the value of that variable is shown as an
arrow pointing to the object. The variable <span class="code">std3</span>, with a value of
<span class="code">null</span>, doesn't point anywhere. The arrows from <span class="code">std1</span> and
<span class="code">std2</span> both point to the same object. This illustrates a Very Important
Point:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>When one object variable is assigned<br>
to another, only a reference is copied.<br>
The object referred to is not copied.</b>
</p>
</div>


<p>When the assignment "<span class="code">std2 = std1</span>;" was executed, no new object was
created. Instead, <span class="code">std2</span> was set to refer to the very same object that
<span class="code">std1</span> refers to. This has some consequences that might be surprising.
For example, <span class="code">std1.name</span> and <span class="code">std2.name</span> are two different names for the
same variable, namely the instance variable in the object that both
<span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to. After the string <span class="code">"Mary
Jones"</span> is assigned to the variable <span class="code"><b>std1</b>.name</span>, it is also
true that the value of <span class="code"><b>std2</b>.name</span> is <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span>.
There is a potential for a lot of confusion here, but you can help protect
yourself from it if you keep telling yourself, "The object is not in the
variable. The variable just holds a pointer to the object."</p>


<p>You can test objects for equality and inequality using the operators <span class="code">==</span> and
<span class="code">!=</span>, but here again, the semantics are different from what you are used to. When
you make a test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(std1&nbsp;==&nbsp;std2)</span>", you are testing whether the
values stored in <span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> are the same. But the values
are references to objects, not objects. So, you are testing whether
<span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to the same object, that is, whether they
point to the same location in memory. This is fine, if its what you want to do.
But sometimes, what you want to check is whether the instance variables in the
objects have the same values. To do that, you would need to ask whether 
"<span class="code">std1.test1 == std2.test1 &amp;&amp; std1.test2 == std2.test2 &amp;&amp;
std1.test3 == std2.test3 &amp;&amp; std1.name.equals(std2.name)</span>".</p>


<p>I've remarked previously that <span class="code">Strings</span> are objects, and I've shown
the strings <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span> and <span class="code">"John Smith"</span> as objects in the
above illustration. A variable of type <span class="classname">String</span> can only hold a
reference to a string, not the string itself. It could also hold the value
<span class="code">null</span>, meaning that it does not refer to any string at all. This
explains why using the <span class="code">==</span> operator to test strings for equality is not
a good idea. Suppose that <span class="code">greeting</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">String</span>, and that the string it refers to is <span class="code">"Hello"</span>. Then
would the test <span class="code">greeting == "Hello"</span> be true? Well, maybe, maybe not.
The variable <span class="code">greeting</span> and the <span class="classname">String</span> literal <span class="code">"Hello"</span>
each refer to a string that contains the characters H-e-l-l-o. But the strings
could still be different objects, that just happen to contain the same
characters. The function <span class="code">greeting.equals("Hello")</span> tests whether
<span class="code">greeting</span> and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters, which is
almost certainly the question you want to ask. The expression 
<span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> tests whether <span class="code">greeting</span> 
and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters <b>stored in the same memory location</b>.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The fact that variables hold references to objects, not objects themselves,
has a couple of other consequences that you should be aware of. They follow
logically, if you just keep in mind the basic fact that the object is not
stored in the variable. The object is somewhere else; the variable points to it.</p>


<p>Suppose that a variable that refers to an object is declared to be
<span class="code">final</span>. This means that the value stored in the variable can never be
changed, once the variable has been initialized. The value stored in the
variable is a reference to the object. So the variable will continue to refer
to the same object as long as the variable exists. However, this does not
prevent the data <b>in the object</b> from changing. The variable is
<span class="code">final</span>, not the object. It's perfectly legal to say</p>


<pre>final Student stu = new Student();

stu.name = "John Doe";  // Change data in the object;
                        // The value stored in stu is not changed!
                        // It still refers to the same object.</pre>


<p>Next, suppose that <span class="code">obj</span> is a variable that refers to an object.
Let's consider what happens when <span class="code">obj</span> is passed as an actual parameter
to a subroutine. The value of <span class="code">obj</span> is assigned to a formal parameter in
the subroutine, and the subroutine is executed. The subroutine has no power to
change the value stored in the variable, <span class="code">obj</span>. It only has a copy of
that value. However, that value is a reference to an object. Since the
subroutine has a reference to the object, it can change the data stored in the
object. After the subroutine ends, <span class="code">obj</span> still points to the same
object, but the data stored <b>in the object</b> might have changed.
Suppose <span class="code">x</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="code">stu</span> is a
variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>. Compare:</p>


<pre>void dontChange(int z) {                void change(Student s) {
    z = 42;                                  s.name = "Fred";
}                                       }

<span class="newcode">The lines:                              The lines:</span>

   x = 17;                                 stu.name = "Jane";
   dontChange(x);                          change(stu);
   System.out.println(x);                  System.out.println(stu.name);
 
<span class="newcode">output the value 17.                    output the value "Fred".
 
The value of x is not                   The value of stu is not
changed by the subroutine,              changed, but stu.name is.
which is equivalent to                  This is equivalent to</span>

   z = x;                                  s = stu;
   z = 42;                                 s.name = "Fred";</pre>

<p>When writing new classes, it's a good idea to pay attention to the issue
of access control.  Recall that making a member of a class <span class="code">public</span>
makes it accessible from anywhere, including from other classes.  On the
other hand, a <span class="code">private</span> member can only be used in the class
where it is defined.</p>
   

<p>In the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variables should
be declared <span class="code">private</span>.  This gives you complete control over what
can be done with the variable.  Even if the variable itself is private,
you can allow other classes to find out what its value is by providing
a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="newword">accessor method</span> that returns the
value of the variable.  For example, if your class contains a <span class="code">private</span>
member variable, <span class="code">title</span>, of type <span class="classname">String</span>, you
can provide a method</p>


<pre>public String getTitle() {
    return title;
}</pre>

   

<p>that returns the value of <span class="code">title</span>.  By convention, the name of
an accessor method for a variable is obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and
adding "get" in front of the name.  So, for the variable <span class="code">title</span>, we get
an accessor method named "get" <span class="code">+</span> "Title", or <span class="code">getTitle()</span>.
Because of this naming convention, accessor methods are more often referred to
as <span class="newword">getter methods</span>.  A getter method provides "read access" to
a variable.</p>
   

<p>You might also want to allow "write access" to a <span class="code">private</span> variable.
That is, you might want to make it possible for other classes to specify a new value
for the variable.  This is done with a <span class="newword">setter method</span>.  (If you don't
like simple, Anglo-Saxon words, you can use the fancier term <span class="newword">mutator method</span>.)
The name of a setter method should consist of "set" followed by a capitalized copy of
the variable's name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as the
variable.  A setter method for the variable <span class="code">title</span> could be written</p>
   

<pre>public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   title = newTitle;
}</pre>
   

<p>It is actually very common to provide both a getter and a setter method for
a private member variable.  Since this allows other classes both to see and to
change the value of the variable, you might wonder why not just make the
variable <span class="code">public</span>?  The reason is that getters and setters are not
restricted to simply reading and writing the variable's value.  In fact,
they can take any action at all.  For example, a getter method might keep
track of the number of times that the variable has been accessed:</p>


<pre>public String getTitle() {
    titleAccessCount++;  // Increment member variable titleAccessCount.
    return title;
}</pre>


<p>and a setter method might check that the value that is being
assigned to the variable is legal:</p>
   

<pre>public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   if ( newTitle == null )   // Don't allow null strings as titles!
      title = "(Untitled)";  // Use an appropriate default value instead.
   else
      title = newTitle;
}</pre>
   

<p>Even if you can't think of any extra chores to do in a getter or setter
method, you might change your mind in the future when you redesign and
improve your class.  If you've used a getter and setter from the beginning,
you can make the modification to your class without affecting any of the
classes that use your class.  The <span class="code">private</span> member variable
is not part of the public interface of your class; only the <span class="code">public</span>
getter and setter methods are.   If you <b>haven't</b> used get and set from
the beginning, you'll have to contact everyone who uses your class and
tell them, "Sorry guys, you'll have to track down every use that you've
made of this variable and change your code to use my new get and set
methods instead."</p>
   

<p>A couple of final notes:  Some advanced aspects of Java rely on the
naming convention for getter and setter methods, so it's a good idea to
follow the convention rigorously.  And though I've been talking about using
getter and setter methods for a variable, you can define get and set
methods even if there is no variable.  A getter and/or setter method defines
a <span class="newword">property</span> of the class, that might or might not correspond
to a variable.  For example, if a class includes a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="code">void</span>
instance method with signature <span class="code">setValue(double)</span>, then the class
has a "property" named <span class="code">value</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, and
it has this property whether or not the class has a member variable
named <span class="code">value</span>.
