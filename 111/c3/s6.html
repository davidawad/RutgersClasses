<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he second branching statement</span> in Java is the
<span class="code">switch</span> statement, which is introduced in this section. The
<span class="code">switch</span> statement is used far less often than the <span class="code">if</span> statement, but it
is sometimes useful for expressing a certain type of multi-way branch.</p>

</h3>


<p>A switch statement allows you to test the value of an expression and,
depending on that value, to jump directly to some location within the switch statement.
Only expressions of certain types can be used.  The value of the expression
can be one of the primitive integer types <span class="ptype">int</span>,
<span class="ptype">short</span>, or <span class="ptype">byte</span>.
It can be the primitive <span class="ptype">char</span> type.  Or, as we will see
later in this section, it can be an enumuerated type.  In particular,
the expression <b>cannot</b> be a <span class="classname">String</span> or a real number. The positions
that you can jump to are marked with <span class="newword">case labels</span> that take the form: 
"case&nbsp;<span class="bnf">constant</span>:". This marks the position the
computer jumps to when the expression evaluates to the given <span class="bnf">constant</span>. 
As the final case in a switch statement you can,
optionally, use the label "default:", which provides a default jump point that
is used when the value of the expression is not listed in any case label.</p>


<p>A <span class="code">switch</span> statement, as it is most often used, has the form:</p>


<pre>switch (<span class="bnf">expression</span>) {
   case <span class="bnf">constant-1</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-1</span>
      break;
   case <span class="bnf">constant-2</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-2</span>
      break;
      .
      .   // (more cases)
      .
   case <span class="bnf">constant-N</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-N</span>
      break;
   default:  // optional default case
      <span class="bnf">statements-(N+1)</span>
} // end of switch statement</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">break</span> statements are technically optional. The effect of a
<span class="code">break</span> is to make the computer jump to the end of the switch statement.
If you leave out the break statement, the computer will just forge ahead after
completing one case and will execute the statements associated with the next
case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is legal. (I will note here -- although 
you won't understand it until you get to the next chapter -- that
inside a subroutine, the <span class="code">break</span> statement is sometimes replaced by a
<span class="code">return</span> statement.)</p>


<p>Note that you can leave out one of the groups of statements entirely
(including the <span class="code">break</span>). You then have two case labels in a row,
containing two different constants. This just means that the computer will jump
to the same place and perform the same action for each of the two
constants.</p>


<p>Here is an example of a switch statement. This is not a useful example, but
it should be easy for you to follow. Note, by the way, that the constants in
the case labels don't have to be in any particular order, as long as they are
all different:</p>


<pre>switch ( N ) {   // (Assume N is an integer variable.)
   case 1:
      System.out.println("The number is 1.");
      break;
   case 2:
   case 4:
   case 8:
      System.out.println("The number is 2, 4, or 8.");
      System.out.println("(That's a power of 2!)");
      break;
   case 3:
   case 6:
   case 9:
      System.out.println("The number is 3, 6, or 9.");
      System.out.println("(That's a multiple of 3!)");
      break;
   case 5:
      System.out.println("The number is 5.");
      break;
   default:
      System.out.println("The number is 7 or is outside the range 1 to 9.");
}</pre>

   

<p>The switch statement is pretty primitive as control structures go, and it's
easy to make mistakes when you use it. Java takes all its control structures
directly from the older programming languages C and C++. The switch statement
is certainly one place where the designers of Java should have introduced some
improvements.</p>

<a name="control.6.2">3.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Menus and switch Statements</a>
</h3>


<p>One application of <span class="code">switch</span> statements is in processing menus. A menu
is a list of options. The user selects one of the options. The computer has to
respond to each possible choice in a different way. If the options are numbered
1, 2,&nbsp;..., then the number of the chosen option can be used in a
<span class="code">switch</span> statement to select the proper response.</p>


<p>In a <span class="classname">TextIO</span>-based program, the menu can be presented as a numbered
list of options, and the user can choose an option by typing in its number.
Here is an example that could be used in a variation of the
<span class="code">LengthConverter</span> example from the <a href="../c3/s5.html">previous
section</a>:</p>


<pre>int optionNumber;   // Option number from menu, selected by user.
double measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.
                    //    The unit of measurement depends on which
                    //    option the user has selected.
double inches;      // The same measurement, converted into inches.

/* Display menu and get user's selected option number. */

TextIO.putln("What unit of measurement does your input use?");
TextIO.putln();
TextIO.putln("         1.  inches");
TextIO.putln("         2.  feet");
TextIO.putln("         3.  yards");
TextIO.putln("         4.  miles");
TextIO.putln();
TextIO.putln("Enter the number of your choice: ");
optionNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */

switch ( optionNumber ) {
   case 1:
       TextIO.putln("Enter the number of inches: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement;
       break;          
   case 2:
       TextIO.putln("Enter the number of feet: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12;
       break;          
   case 3:
       TextIO.putln("Enter the number of yards: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 36;
       break;          
   case 4:
       TextIO.putln("Enter the number of miles: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12 * 5280;
       break;
   default:
       TextIO.putln("Error!  Illegal option number!  I quit!");
       System.exit(1);          
} // end switch

/* Now go on to convert inches to feet, yards, and miles... */</pre>

<a name="control.6.3">3.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Enums in switch Statements</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The type of the expression in a <span class="code">switch</span> can be an enumerated
type.  In that case, the constants in the <span class="code">case</span> labels must
be values from the enumerated type.  For example, if the type of
the expression is the enumerated type <span class="classname">Season</span>
defined by</p>


<pre>enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER }</pre>


<p>then the constants in the case label must be chosen from among
the values <span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>, <span class="code">Season.SUMMER</span>, <span class="code">Season.FALL</span>, or
<span class="code">Season.WINTER</span>.  However, there is another quirk in the syntax:
when an enum constant is used in a <span class="code">case</span> label, only the simple name,
such as "<span class="code">SPRING</span>" can be used, not the full name "<span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>".
Of course, the computer already knows that the value in the <span class="code">case</span> label
must belong to the enumerated type, since it can tell that from the type of expression
used, so there is really no need to specify the type name in the constant.  As an
example, suppose that <span class="code">currentSeason</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">Season</span>.  Then we could have the <span class="code">switch</span> statement:</p>
  

<pre>switch ( currentSeason ) {
   case WINTER:    // ( NOT Season.WINTER ! )
      System.out.println("December, January, February");
      break;
   case SPRING:
      System.out.println("March, April, May");
      break;
   case SUMMER:
      System.out.println("June, July, August");
      break;
   case FALL:
      System.out.println("September, October, November");
      break;
}</pre>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.6.4">3.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Definite Assignment</a>
</h3>
   

<p>As a somewhat more realistic example, the following <span class="code">switch</span> statement
makes a random choice among three possible alternatives.  Recall that the
value of the expression <span class="code">(int)(3*Math.random())</span> is one of the
integers 0, 1, or 2, selected at random with equal probability, so the
<span class="code">switch</span> statement below will assign one of the values
<span class="code">"Rock"</span>, <span class="code">"Scissors"</span>, <span class="code">"Paper"</span> to <span class="code">computerMove</span>,
with probability 1/3 for each case.   Although
the switch statement in this example is correct, this code segment as a
whole illustrates a subtle syntax error that sometimes comes up:</p>


<pre>String computerMove;
switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      computerMove = "Rock";
      break;
   case 1:
      computerMove = "Scissors";
      break;
   case 2:
      computerMove = "Paper";
      break;
}
System.out.println("Computer's move is " + computerMove);   // ERROR!</pre>
   

<p>You probably haven't spotted the error, since it's not an error
from a human point of view.  The computer reports the last line to be
an error, because the variable <span class="code">computerMove</span> might not have
been assigned a value.  In Java, it is only legal to use the value
of a variable if a value has already been <span class="newword">definitely assigned</span>
to that variable.  This means that the computer must be able to prove, just
from looking at the code when the program is compiled, that the variable
must have been assigned a value.  Unfortunately, the computer only
has a few simple rules that it can apply to make the determination.
In this case, it sees a <span class="code">switch</span> statement in which the
type of expression is <span class="ptype">int</span> and in which the cases that
are covered are 0, 1, and 2.  For other values of the expression,
<span class="code">computerMove</span> is never assigned a value.  So, the computer
thinks <span class="code">computerMove</span> might still be undefined after
the <span class="code">switch</span> statement.  Now, in fact, this isn't true:
0, 1, and 2 are actually the only possible values of the expression
<span class="code">(int)(3*Math.random())</span>, but the computer isn't smart
enough to figure that out.  The easiest way to fix the problem
is to replace the case label <span class="code">case&nbsp;2</span> with
<span class="code">default</span>.  The computer can see that a value
is assigned to <span class="code">computerMove</span> in all cases.</p>


<p>More generally, we say that a value has been definitely assigned
to a variable at a given point in a program if every execution
path leading from the declaration of the variable to that point in the
code includes an assignment to the variable.  This rule takes into
account loops and <span class="code">if</span> statements as well as <span class="code">switch</span>
statements.  For example, the following two <span class="code">if</span> statements
both do the same thing as the <span class="code">switch</span> statement given
above, but only the one on the right definitely assigns a value
to <span class="code">computerMove</span>:</p>


<pre>String computerMove;                     String computerMove;
int rand;                                int rand;
rand = (int)(3*Math.random());           rand = (int)(3*Math.random());
if ( rand == 0 )                         if ( rand == 0 )
   computerMove = "Rock";                   computerMove = "Rock";
else if ( rand == 1 )                    else if ( rand == 1 )
   computerMove = "Scissors";               computerMove = "Scissors";
else <span class="newcode">if ( rand == 2 )</span>                    else
   computerMove = "Paper";                  computerMove = "Paper";</pre>
   

<p>In the code on the left, the test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(&nbsp;rand&nbsp;==&nbsp;2&nbsp;)</span>" 
in the final <span class="code">else</span> clause
is unnecessary because if <span class="code">rand</span> is not 0 or 1, the only remaining
possibility is that <span class="code">rand&nbsp;==&nbsp;2</span>.  The computer, however, can't
figure that out.</p>
