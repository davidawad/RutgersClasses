<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>N</big>ot every event</span> is generated by an action on the
part of the user.  Events can also be generated by objects as part of their
regular programming, and these events can be monitored by other objects so that
they can take appropriate actions when the events occur.  One example of this
is the class <span class="code">javax.swing.Timer</span>.  A <span class="classname">Timer</span>
generates events at regular intervals.  These events can be used to drive
an animation or to perform some other task at regular intervals.  We will
begin this section with a look at timer events and animation.  We will then
look at another type of basic user-generated event:  the <span class="classname">KeyEvents</span>
that are generated when the user types on the keyboard.  The example at the end
of the section uses both a timer and keyboard events to implement a simple game.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.5.1">6.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Timers and Animation</a>
</h3>
   

<p>An object belonging to the class <span class="code">javax.swing.Timer</span> exists only to
generate events.  A <span class="classname">Timer</span>, by default, generates a sequence of events
with a fixed delay between each event and the next.  (It is also possible to set a
<span class="classname">Timer</span> to emit a single event after a specified time delay;
in that case, the timer is being used as an "alarm.")  Each event belongs to the
class <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>.  An object that is to listen for the
events must implement the interface <span class="classname">ActionListener</span>, which
defines just one method:</p>
   

<pre>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)</pre>
   

<p>To use a <span class="classname">Timer</span>, you must create an object that
implements the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface.  That is, the
object must belong to a class that is declared to "<span class="code">implement ActionListener</span>",
and that class must define the <span class="code">actionPerformed</span> method.  Then, if
the object is set to listen for events from the timer, the code in the listener's
<span class="code">actionPerformed</span> method will be executed every time the timer generates
an event.</p>
   

<p>Since there is no point to having a timer without having a listener to respond to
its events, the action listener for a timer is specified as a parameter in the
timer's constructor.  The time delay between timer events is also specified in
the constructor.  If <span class="code">timer</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Timer</span>,
then the statement</p>
   

<pre>timer = new Timer( millisDelay, listener );</pre>
   

<p>creates a timer with a delay of <span class="code">millisDelay</span> milliseconds
between events (where 1000 milliseconds equal one second).  Events from the
timer are sent to the <span class="code">listener</span>.  (<span class="code">millisDelay</span> must be
of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, and <span class="code">listener</span> must be of type
<span class="classname">ActionListener</span>.)   Note that a timer is not guaranteed
to deliver events at precisely regular intervals.  If the computer is busy
with some other task, an event might be delayed or even dropped altogether.</p>
   

<p>A timer does not automatically start generating events when the timer object
is created.  The <span class="code">start()</span> method in the timer must be called to tell
the timer to start generating events.  The timer's <span class="code">stop()</span> method
can be used to turn the stream of events off -- it can be restarted by calling
<span class="code">start()</span> again.</p>

   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>One application of timers is computer animation.
A computer animation is just a sequence of still images, presented to the user
one after the other.  If the time between images is short, and if the change from one
image to another is not too great, then the user perceives continuous motion.
The easiest way to do animation in Java is to use a <span class="classname">Timer</span> to
drive the animation.  Each time the timer generates an event, the next frame of
the animation is computed and drawn on the screen -- the code that implements this goes
in the <span class="code">actionPerformed</span> method of an object that listens for events from
the timer.</p>


<p>Our first example of using a timer is not exactly an animation, but it does
display a new image for each timer event.  The program shows randomly generated
images that vaguely resemble works of abstract art.  In fact, the program
draws a new random image every time its <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method is
called, and the response to a timer event is simply to call <span class="code">repaint()</span>,
which in turn triggers a call to <span class="code">paintComponent</span>.  The work
of the program is done in a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>, which
starts like this:</p>
   

<pre>import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class RandomArtPanel extends JPanel {
   
   /**
    * A RepaintAction object calls the repaint method of this panel each
    * time its actionPerformed() method is called.  An object of this
    * type is used as an action listener for a Timer that generates an
    * ActionEvent every four seconds.  The result is that the panel is
    * redrawn every four seconds.
    */
   private class RepaintAction implements ActionListener {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
         repaint();  // Call the repaint() method in the panel class.
      }
   }
   
   /**
    * The constructor creates a timer with a delay time of four seconds
    * (4000 milliseconds), and with a RepaintAction object as its
    * ActionListener.  It also starts the timer running.
    */
   public RandomArtPanel() {
      RepaintAction action = new RepaintAction();
      Timer timer = new Timer(4000, action);
      timer.start();
   }
   
   /**
    * The paintComponent() method fills the panel with a random shade of
    * gray and then draws one of three types of random "art".  The type
    * of art to be drawn is chosen at random.
    */
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
       .
       .   // The rest of the class is omitted
       .</pre>
   

<p>You can find the full source code for this class in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtPanel.java">RandomArtPanel.java</a></span>;
An application version of the program is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArt.java">RandomArt.java</a></span>, while the applet
version is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomArtApplet.java">RandomArtApplet.java</a></span>.  Here is the applet:</p>

<p>Later in this section, we will use a timer to drive the animation in a simple
computer game.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.5.2">6.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard Events</a>
</h3>


<p>In Java, user actions become events in a program. These events
are associated with GUI components.
When the user presses a button on the mouse, the event that is generated is
associated with the component that contains the mouse cursor. What about
keyboard events? When the user presses a key, what component is associated with
the key event that is generated?</p>


<p>A GUI uses the idea of <span class="newword">input focus</span> to determine
the component associated with keyboard events. At any given time, exactly one
interface element on the screen has the input focus, and that is where all
keyboard events are directed. If the interface element happens to be a Java
component, then the information about the keyboard event becomes a Java object
of type <span class="classname">KeyEvent</span>, and it is delivered to any listener objects that are
listening for <span class="code">KeyEvents</span> associated with that component. The necessity
of managing input focus adds an extra twist to working with keyboard events.</p>


<p>It's a good idea to give the user some visual feedback about which component
has the input focus. For example, if the component is the typing area of a
word-processor, the feedback is usually in the form of a blinking text cursor.
Another common visual clue is to draw a brightly colored border around the edge
of a component when it has the input focus, as I do in the examples given
later in this section.</p>


<p>A component that wants to have the input focus can call the method
<span class="code">requestFocus()</span>, which is defined in the <span class="code">Component</span> class.
Calling this method does not absolutely guarantee that the component will
actually get the input focus. Several components might request the focus; only
one will get it. This method should only be used in certain circumstances in
any case, since it can be a rude surprise to the user to have the focus
suddenly pulled away from a component that the user is working with. In a
typical user interface, the user can choose to give the focus to a component by
clicking on that component with the mouse. And pressing the tab key will often
move the focus from one component to another.</p>


<p>Some components do not automatically request the input focus when the user
clicks on them. To solve this problem, a program has to register a mouse
listener with the component to detect user clicks. In response to a user click,
the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method should call <span class="code">requestFocus()</span> for the
component. This is true, in particular, for the components that are used as
drawing surfaces in the examples in this chapter. These components are defined
as subclasses of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>, and <span class="classname">JPanel</span> objects do not receive the input
focus automatically. If you want to be able to use the keyboard to interact
with a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> named <span class="code">drawingSurface</span>, you have to register a listener to
listen for mouse events on the <span class="code">drawingSurface</span> and call
<span class="code">drawingSurface.requestFocus()</span> in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method of
the listener object.</p>


<p>As our first example of processing key events, we look at a simple program in
which the user moves a square up, down, left, and right by pressing arrow keys.
When the user hits the 'R', 'G', 'B', or 'K' key, the color of the square is set to
red, green, blue, or black, respectively.  Of course, none of these key events
are delivered to the program unless it has the input focus.  The panel in the
program changes its appearance when it has the input focus:  When it does,
a cyan-colored border is drawn around the panel; when it does not, a gray-colored
border is drawn.  Also, the panel displays a different message in each case.
If the panel does not have the input focus, the user can give the input focus
to the panel by clicking on it.  The complete source code for this example
can be found in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/KeyboardAndFocusDemo.java">KeyboardAndFocusDemo.java</a></span>. I will
discuss some aspects of it below. After reading this section, you should be
able to understand the source code in its entirety.
Here is the applet version of this program (Note that in some browsers,
you might have to leave the mouse positioned inside the applet, in order for it to 
receive key events):</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="KeyboardAndFocusDemo.class" width="300" height="240" archive="KeyboardAndFocusDemo.jar" alt="(Applet 'KeyboardAndFocusDemo' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>


<p>In Java, keyboard event objects belong to a class called <span class="classname">KeyEvent</span>.
An object that needs to listen for <span class="classname">KeyEvents</span> must implement the
interface named <span class="classname">KeyListener</span>. Furthermore, the object must be
registered with a component by calling the component's
<span class="code">addKeyListener()</span> method. The registration is done with the command
"<span class="code">component.addKeyListener(listener);</span>" where <span class="code">listener</span> is the
object that is to listen for key events, and <span class="code">component</span> is the object
that will generate the key events (when it has the input focus). It is possible
for <span class="code">component</span> and <span class="code">listener</span> to be the same object. All this
is, of course, directly analogous to what you learned about mouse events in the
<a href="../c6/s4.html">previous section</a>. The <span class="classname">KeyListener</span> interface
defines the following methods, which must be included in any class that
implements <span class="classname">KeyListener</span>:</p>


<pre>public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt);
public void keyReleased(KeyEvent evt);
public void keyTyped(KeyEvent evt);</pre>


<p>Java makes a careful distinction between <i>the keys that you press</i> and
<i>the characters that you type</i>. There are lots of keys on a keyboard:
letter keys, number keys, modifier keys such as Control and Shift, arrow keys,
page up and page down keys, keypad keys, function keys. In many cases, pressing
a key does not type a character. On the other hand, typing a character
sometimes involves pressing several keys. For example, to type an uppercase
'A', you have to press the Shift key and then press the A key before releasing
the Shift key. On my Macintosh computer, I can type an accented e, by
holding down the Option key, pressing the E key, releasing the Option key, and
pressing E again. Only one character was typed, but I had to perform three
key-presses and I had to release a key at the right time. In Java, there are
three types of <span class="classname">KeyEvent</span>. The types correspond to pressing a key,
releasing a key, and typing a character. The <span class="code">keyPressed</span> method is
called when the user presses a key, the <span class="code">keyReleased</span> method is called
when the user releases a key, and the <span class="code">keyTyped</span> method is called when
the user types a character. Note that one user action, such as pressing the E
key, can be responsible for two events, a <span class="code">keyPressed</span> event and a
<span class="code">keyTyped</span> event. Typing an upper case 'A' can generate two
<span class="code">keyPressed</span>, two <span class="code">keyReleased</span>, and one <span class="code">keyTyped</span>
event.</p>


<p>Usually, it is better to think in terms of two separate streams of events,
one consisting of <span class="code">keyPressed</span> and <span class="code">keyReleased</span> events and the
other consisting of <span class="code">keyTyped</span> events. For some applications, you want
to monitor the first stream; for other applications, you want to monitor the
second one. Of course, the information in the <span class="code">keyTyped</span> stream could be
extracted from the <span class="code">keyPressed/keyReleased</span> stream, but it would be
difficult (and also system-dependent to some extent). Some user actions, such
as pressing the Shift key, can only be detected as <span class="code">keyPressed</span> events.
I have a solitaire game on my computer that hilites every card that can be
moved, when I hold down the Shift key. You could do something like that in Java
by hiliting the cards when the Shift key is pressed and removing the hilite
when the Shift key is released.</p>


<p>There is one more complication. Usually, when you hold down a key on the
keyboard, that key will <span class="newword">auto-repeat</span>. This means
that it will generate multiple <span class="code">keyPressed</span> events, as long as it is
held down. It can also generate multiple <span class="code">keyTyped</span> events. For the most
part, this will not affect your programming, but you should not expect every
<span class="code">keyPressed</span> event to have a corresponding <span class="code">keyReleased</span>
event.</p>


<p>Every key on the keyboard has an integer code number. (Actually, this is
only true for keys that Java knows about. Many keyboards have extra keys that
can't be used with Java.) When the <span class="code">keyPressed</span> or <span class="code">keyReleased</span>
method is called, the parameter, <span class="code">evt</span>, contains the code of the key
that was pressed or released. The code can be obtained by calling the function
<span class="code">evt.getKeyCode()</span>. Rather than asking you to memorize a table of code
numbers, Java
provides a named constant for each key. These constants are defined in the
<span class="classname">KeyEvent</span> class. For example the constant for the shift key is
<span class="code">KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT</span>. If you want to test whether the key that the user
pressed is the Shift key, you could say "<span class="code">if (evt.getKeyCode() ==
KeyEvent.VK_SHIFT)</span>". The key codes for the four arrow keys are
<span class="code">KeyEvent.VK_LEFT</span>, <span class="code">KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT</span>, <span class="code">KeyEvent.VK_UP</span>,
and <span class="code">KeyEvent.VK_DOWN</span>. Other keys have similar codes. (The "VK" stands
for "Virtual Keyboard". In reality, different keyboards use different key
codes, but Java translates the actual codes from the keyboard into its own
"virtual" codes. Your program only sees these virtual key codes, so it will
work with various keyboards on various platforms without modification.)</p>


<p>In the case of a <span class="code">keyTyped</span> event, you want to know which character
was typed. This information can be obtained from the parameter, <span class="code">evt</span>,
in the <span class="code">keyTyped</span> method by calling the function
<span class="code">evt.getKeyChar()</span>. This function returns a value of type <span class="ptype">char</span>
representing the character that was typed.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">KeyboardAndFocusDemo</span> program, shown above, I use the
<span class="code">keyPressed</span> routine to respond when the user presses one of the arrow
keys. The applet includes instance variables, <span class="code">squareLeft</span> and
<span class="code">squareTop</span>, that give the position of the upper left corner of the movable
square. When the user presses one of the arrow keys, the <span class="code">keyPressed</span>
routine modifies the appropriate instance variable and calls
<span class="code">repaint()</span> to redraw the panel with the square in its new position. Note that the
values of <span class="code">squareLeft</span> and <span class="code">squareTop</span> are restricted so that
the square never moves outside the white area of the panel:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This is called each time the user presses a key while the panel has
 * the input focus.  If the key pressed was one of the arrow keys,
 * the square is moved (except that it is not allowed to move off the
 * edge of the panel, allowing for a 3-pixel border).
 */
public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) { 
   
   int key = evt.getKeyCode();  // keyboard code for the pressed key
   
   if (key == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) {  // move the square left
      squareLeft -= 8;
      if (squareLeft &lt; 3)
         squareLeft = 3;
      repaint();
   }
   else if (key == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT) {  // move the square right
      squareLeft += 8;
      if (squareLeft &gt; getWidth() - 3 - SQUARE_SIZE)
         squareLeft = getWidth() - 3 - SQUARE_SIZE;
      repaint();
   }
   else if (key == KeyEvent.VK_UP) {  // move the squre up
      squareTop -= 8;
      if (squareTop &lt; 3)
         squareTop = 3;
      repaint();
   }
   else if (key == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN) {  // move the square down
      squareTop += 8;
      if (squareTop &gt; getHeight() - 3 - SQUARE_SIZE)
         squareTop = getHeight() - 3 - SQUARE_SIZE;
      repaint();
   }
   
}  // end keyPressed()</pre>


<p>Color changes -- which happen when the user types the characters 'R', 'G',
'B', and 'K', or the lower case equivalents -- are handled in the
<span class="code">keyTyped</span> method. I won't include it here, since it is so similar to
the <span class="code">keyPressed</span> method. Finally, to complete the <span class="classname">KeyListener</span>
interface, the <span class="code">keyReleased</span> method must be defined. In the sample
program, the body of this method is empty since the applet does nothing in
response to <span class="code">keyReleased</span> events.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.5.3">6.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus Events</a>
</h3>


<p>If a component is to change its appearance when it has the input focus, it
needs some way to know when it has the focus. In Java, objects are notified
about changes of input focus by events of type <span class="classname">FocusEvent</span>. An object
that wants to be notified of changes in focus can implement the
<span class="classname">FocusListener</span> interface. This interface declares two methods:</p>


<pre>public void focusGained(FocusEvent evt);
public void focusLost(FocusEvent evt);</pre>


<p>Furthermore, the <span class="code">addFocusListener()</span> method must be used to set up a
listener for the focus events. When a component gets the input focus, it calls
the <span class="code">focusGained()</span> method of any object that has been registered with
that component as a <span class="classname">FocusListener</span>. When it loses the focus, it calls
the listener's <span class="code">focusLost()</span> method. Sometimes, it is the component itself
that listens for focus events.</p>


<p>In the sample <span class="code">KeyboardAndFocusDemo</span> program,  the response to
a focus event is simply to redraw the panel.  The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method checks whether the panel has the input focus by calling the
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">hasFocus()</span>, which is
defined in the <span class="classname">Component</span> class, and it draws a
different picture depending on whether or not the panel has the input focus.
The net result is that the appearance of the panel changes when the panel
gains or loses focus.  The methods from the <span class="classname">FocusListener</span>
interface are defined simply as:</p>


<pre>public void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) {
       // The panel now has the input focus.
   repaint();  // will redraw with a new message and a cyan border
}
 
public void focusLost(FocusEvent evt) {
      // The panel has now lost the input focus.
   repaint();  // will redraw with a new message and a gray border
}</pre>


<p>The other aspect of handling focus is to make sure that the <span class="code">panel</span>
gets the focus when the user clicks on it. To do this, the panel implements
the <span class="code">MouseListener</span> interface and listens for mouse events on
itself. It defines a <span class="code">mousePressed</span> routine that asks that the
input focus be given to the panel:</p>


<pre>public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {
   requestFocus();
}</pre>


<p>The other four methods of the <span class="code">mouseListener</span> interface are defined
to be empty. Note that the panel implements three different listener interfaces, 
<span class="classname">KeyListener</span>, <span class="classname">FocusListener</span>,
and <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>, and the constructor in the panel class
registers itself to listen for all three types of events with the statements:</p>
   

<pre>addKeyListener(this);
addFocusListener(this);
addMouseListener(this);</pre>


<p>There are, of course, other ways to organize this example.  It would be
possible, for example, to use a nested class to define the listening
object.  Or anonymous classes could be used to define
separate listening objects for each type of event.   In my next example,
I will take the latter approach.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI1.5.4">6.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;State Machines</a>
</h3>


<p>The information stored in an object's instance variables is said to
represent the <span class="newword">state</span> of that object. When one of
the object's methods is called, the action taken by the object can depend on
its state. (Or, in the terminology we have been using, the definition of the
method can look at the instance variables to decide what to do.) Furthermore,
the state can change. (That is, the definition of the method can assign new
values to the instance variables.) In computer science, there is the idea of a
<span class="newword">state machine</span>, which is just something that has a
state and can change state in response to events or inputs. The response of a
state machine to an event or input depends on what state it's in. An object is
a kind of state machine. Sometimes, this point of view can be very useful in
designing classes.</p>


<p>The state machine point of view can be especially useful in the type of
event-oriented programming that is required by graphical user interfaces. When
designing a GUI program, you can ask yourself: What information about state do I
need to keep track of? What events can change the state of the program? How will
my response to a given event depend on the current state? Should the appearance
of the GUI be changed to reflect a change in state? How should the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method take the state into account? All this is an
alternative to the top-down, step-wise-refinement style of program design,
which does not apply to the overall design of an event-oriented program.</p>


<p>In the <span class="classname">KeyboardAndFocusDemo</span> program, shown above, the state of the
program is recorded in the instance variables <span class="code">squareColor</span>,
<span class="code">squareLeft</span>, and <span class="code">squareTop</span>. These state variables are used in
the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method to decide how to draw the panel. They are
changed in the two key-event-handling methods.</p>


<p>In the rest of this section, we'll look at another example, where the state
plays an even bigger role. In this example, the user plays a
simple arcade-style game by pressing the arrow keys.  The main panel of the
program is defined in the souce code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerPanel.java">SubKillerPanel.java</a></span>.
An applet that uses this panel can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerApplet.java">SubKillerApplet.java</a></span>,
while the stand-alone application version is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKiller.java">SubKiller.java</a></span>.
You can try out the applet here:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="SubKillerApplet.class" width="500" height="380" archive="SubKiller.jar" alt="(Applet 'SubKillerApplet' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>


<p>You have to click on the panel to give it the input focus. 
The program shows a black "submarine" near the bottom of the panel.
When the panel has the input focus, this submarine
moves back and forth erratically near the bottom. Near the top,
there is a blue "boat". You can move this boat back and forth by pressing the
left and right arrow keys. Attached to the boat is a red "bomb" (or "depth charge"). You
can drop the bomb by hitting the down arrow key. The objective is to
blow up the submarine by hitting it with the bomb. If the bomb
falls off the bottom of the screen, you get a new one. If the submarine explodes, a
new sub is created and you get a new bomb. Try it! Make sure to hit the
sub at least once, so you can see the explosion.</p>


<p>Let's think about how this program can be programmed. First of all, since we
are doing object-oriented programming, I decided to represent the boat, the depth
charge, and the submarine as objects.  Each of these objects is defined by a
separate nested class inside the main panel class, and each object has its own
state which is represented by the instance variables in the corresponding class.
I use variables <span class="code">boat</span>, <span class="code">bomb</span>, and <span class="code">sub</span> in
the panel class to refer to the boat, bomb, and submarine objects.</p>


<p>Now, what constitutes the
"state" of the program? That is, what things change from time to time and affect
the appearance or behavior of the program? Of course, the state includes the
positions of the boat, submarine, and bomb, so I need
variables to store the positions. Anything else, possibly less obvious? Well,
sometimes the bomb is falling, and sometimes it's not. That is a
difference in state. Since there are two possibilities, I represent this aspect
of the state with a boolean variable in the <span class="code">bomb</span> object, 
<span class="code">bomb.isFalling</span>. Sometimes the
submarine is moving left and sometimes it is moving right. The difference is
represented by another boolean variable, <span class="code">sub.isMovingLeft</span>. Sometimes,
the sub is exploding. This is also part of the state, and it  is represented
by a boolean variable, <span class="code">sub.isExploding</span>.  However, the explosions
require a little more thought.   An explosion is something that takes place
over a series of frames.  While an explosion is in progress, the sub
looks different in each frame, as the size of the explosion increases. Also,
I need to know when the explosion is over so that I can go back to moving and drawing the
sub as usual. So, I use an integer variable, <span class="code">sub.explosionFrameNumber</span>
to record how many frames have been drawn since the explosion
started; the value of this variable is used only when an explosion is in progress.</p>


<p>How and when do the values of these state variables change?  Some of them seem
to change on their own:  For example, as the sub moves left and right, the state variables
that specify its position are changing.  Of course, these variables are changing
because of an animation, and that animation is driven by a timer.  Each time an
event is generated by the timer, some of the state variables have to change to
get ready for the next frame of the animation.  The changes are made by the
action listener that listens for events from the timer.  The <span class="code">boat</span>,
<span class="code">bomb</span>, and <span class="code">sub</span> objects each contain an
<span class="code">updateForNextFrame()</span> method that updates the state variables of
the object to get ready for the next frame of the animation.  The action listener
for the timer calls these methods with the statements</p>
   

<pre>boat.updateForNewFrame();
bomb.updateForNewFrame();
sub.updateForNewFrame();</pre>


<p>The action listener also calls <span class="code">repaint()</span>, so that the panel will be
redrawn to reflect its new state.  There are several state variables that change
in these update methods, in addition to the position of the sub:  If the bomb is
falling, then its y-coordinate increases from one frame to the next.  If the
bomb hits the sub, then the <span class="code">isExploding</span> variable of the sub
changes to true, and the <span class="code">isFalling</span> variable of the bomb becomes <span class="code">false</span>.
The <span class="code">isFalling</span> variable also becomes false when the bomb falls off the
bottom of the screen.  If the sub is exploding, then its <span class="code">explosionFrameNumber</span>
increases from one frame to the next, and when it reaches a certain value, the
explosion ends and <span class="code">isExploding</span> is reset to false.  At random times,
the sub switches between moving to the left and moving to the right.  Its
direction of motion is recorded in the sub's <span class="code">isMovingLeft</span> variable.
The sub's <span class="code">updateForNewFrame()</span> method includes the lines</p>
   

<pre>if ( Math.random() &lt; 0.04 )
   isMovingLeft = ! isMovingLeft;</pre>


<p>There is a 1 in 25 chance that <span class="code">Math.random()</span> will be less than
0.04, so the statement "<span class="code">isMovingLeft = !&nbsp;isMovingLeft</span>" is executed
in one in every twenty-five frames, on the average.  The effect of this statement
is to reverse the value of <span class="code">isMovingLeft</span>, from false to true or from
true to false.  That is, the direction of motion of the sub is reversed.</p>
      

<p>In addition to changes in state that take place from one frame to the next, a few state
variables change when the user presses certain keys. In the program, this is checked
in a method that responds to user keystrokes. If the user presses the left or right
arrow key, the position of the boat is changed. If the user presses the down
arrow key, the bomb changes from not-falling to falling. This is coded in the
<span class="code">keyPressed()</span>method of a <span class="classname">KeyListener</span> that is
registered to listen for key events on the panel; that method 
reads as follows:</p>


<pre>public void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
   int code = evt.getKeyCode();  // which key was pressed.
   if (code == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) {
        // Move the boat left.  (If this moves the boat out of the frame, its
        // position will be adjusted in the boat.updateForNewFrame() method.)
      boat.centerX -= 15;
   }
   else if (code == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT) {  
        // Move the boat right.  (If this moves boat out of the frame, its
        // position will be adjusted in the boat.updateForNewFrame() method.)
      boat.centerX += 15;
   }
   else if (code == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN) {
         // Start the bomb falling, if it is not already falling.
      if ( bomb.isFalling == false )
         bomb.isFalling = true;
   }
}</pre>


<p>Note that it's not necessary to call <span class="code">repaint()</span> when the state
changes, since this panel shows an animation that is constantly being redrawn
anyway. Any changes in the state will become visible to the user as soon as the
next frame is drawn. At some point in the program, I have to make sure that the
user does not move the boat off the screen. I could have done this in
<span class="code">keyPressed()</span>, but I choose to check for this in another routine, in
the boat object.</p>


<p>I encourage you to read the source code in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerPanel.java">SubKillerPanel.java</a></span>.
Although a few points are tricky, you should  with some effort be able to read and
understand the entire program.  Try to understand the program in terms of state
machines.  Note how the state of each of the three objects in the program changes
in response to events from the timer and from the user.</p>
   

<p>You should also note that the program uses four listeners, to respond to
action events from the timer, key events from the user, focus events, and
mouse events.  (The mouse is used only to request the input focus when the user
clicks the panel.)  The timer runs only when the panel has the input focus; this
is programmed by having the focus listener start the timer when the panel
gains the input focus and stop the timer when the panel loses the input focus.
All four listeners are created in the constructor of the <span class="classname">SubKillerPanel</span>
class using anonymous inner classes.  (See <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.5</a>.)</p>


<p>While it's not at all sophisticated as arcade games go, the
SubKiller game does use some interesting programming. And it
nicely illustrates how to apply state-machine thinking in event-oriented
programming.</p>
