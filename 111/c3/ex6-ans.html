<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.6:</h3>
<p>Write an applet that draws
a checkerboard. Assume that the size of the applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each
square in the checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. The checkerboard contains 8 rows
of squares and 8 columns. The squares are red and black. Here is a tricky way
to determine whether a given square is red or black: If the row number and the
column number are either both even or both odd, then the square is red.
Otherwise, it is black. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the
height is equal to the width, so you can use the subroutine
<span class="code">g.fillRect()</span> to draw the squares. Here is an image of the
checkerboard:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="checkerboard.gif" width="170" height="169" alt="checkerboard"></p>


<p>(To run an applet, you need a Web page to display it. A very simple page
will do. Assume that your applet class is called <span class="code">Checkerboard</span>, so that
when you compile it you get a class file named <span class="code">Checkerboard.class</span> Make
a file that contains only the lines:</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="Checkerboard.class" width=160 height=160&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</pre>


<p>Call this file <span class="code">Checkerboard.html</span>. This is the source code for a
simple Web page that shows nothing but your applet. You can open the file in a
Web browser or with Sun's appletviewer program. The compiled class file,
<span class="code">Checkerboard.class</span>, must be in the same directory with the Web-page
file, <span class="code">Checkerboard.html</span>.</p>

<p>(If you are using the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment, you can
simply right-click the name of the source code file in the Package Explorer.
In the pop-up menu, go to "Run&nbsp;As" then to "Java Applet".  This will open
the window in which the applet appears.  The default size for the window
is bigger than 160-by-160, so the drawing of the checkerboard will not fill the
entire window.)</p>

<p>The basic algorithm is obvious:</p>


<pre>for each row on the checkerboard:
    Draw all the squares in that row</pre>


<p>Since any given row contains eight squares, one in each column of the
checkerboard, we can expand the body of the for loop into another for loop:</p>


<pre>for each row on the checkerboard:
    for each of the eight columns:
        Draw the square in that row and column</pre>


<p>Each square is a rectangle with height 20 and width 20, so it can be drawn
with the command <span class="code">g.fillRect(x,y,20,20)</span>, where <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the square. Before
drawing the square, we have to determine whether it should be red or black, and
we have to set the correct color with <span class="code">g.setColor</span>. So, the algorithm
becomes</p>


<pre>for each row on the checkerboard:
    for each of the eight columns:
        Compute x,y for the top-left corner of the square
        if its a red square:
           g.setColor(Color.red)
        else
           g.setColor(Color.black)
        g.fillRect(x,y,20,20)</pre>


<p>The top of the first row of squares is at <span class="code">y=0</span>. Since each square is
20 pixels high, the top of the second row is at <span class="code">y=20</span>, followed by 40
for the third row, then 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140. If we assume that the rows
are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 7, then the tops are given by <span class="code">y&nbsp;=&nbsp;row*20</span>,
where <span class="code">row</span> is the row number. (If you number the rows 1, 2, ..., 8, the
formula would be <span class="code">(row-1)*20</span>. The simpler formula in this and in many
similar cases is one reason why computer scientists like to start counting with
0 instead of 1.) Similarly, the left edge of the squares in column <span class="code">col</span>
is given by <span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;col*20</span>, where again the columns are numbered 0, 1, 2,
..., 7. I'll use "<span class="code">for (row=0; row&lt;8; row++)</span>" to count off the rows,
rather than the equivalent "<span class="code">for (row=0; row&lt;=7; row++)</span>". The 8
reminds me that I am counting off the <b>eight</b> numbers 0, 1, 2,
..., 7. Again, this is typical computer science style.</p>


<p>The only problem remaining is how to determine whether the square is red. As
noted in the exercise, a square is red if <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> are
either both even or both odd. Since an integer <span class="code">N</span> is even if
<span class="code">N%2</span> is 0, the test could be expressed as</p>


<pre>if ((row%2 == 0 &amp;&amp; col%2 == 0) || (row%2 == 1 &amp;&amp; col%2 == 1))</pre>


<p>However,
note that this is the same as asking whether <span class="code">row%2</span> and <span class="code">col%2</span>
have the same value. So the test can be written more simply as "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(row%2&nbsp;==&nbsp;col%2)</span>". Putting this all together into syntactically correct Java
code, the algorithm becomes</p>


<pre>for ( row = 0;  row &lt; 8;  row++ ) {
   for ( col = 0;  col &lt; 8;  col++ ) {
       x = 20*col;
       y = 20*row;
       if ( (row % 2) == (col % 2) )
          g.setColor(Color.red);
       else
          g.setColor(Color.black);
       g.fillRect(x,y,20,20);
   }
}</pre>


<p>Of course, the variables <span class="code">row</span>, <span class="code">col</span>, <span class="code">x</span>, and
<span class="code">y</span> have to be declared to be of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. Then, the code goes
into the body of the <span class="code">paint()</span> method of an applet. The syntax of the
applet definition must follow the format given in <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>.</p>
