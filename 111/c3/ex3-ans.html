<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.3:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7. The expressions
are to be typed in by the user. The input always consist of a number, followed
by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are
+, -, *, and /. You can read the numbers with <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span> and
the operator with <span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span>. Your program should read an
expression, print its value, read another expression, print its value, and so
on. The program should end when the user enters 0 as the first number on the
line.</p>

<p>We need a loop to read and evaluate expressions. It's easiest to use a
<span class="code">break</span> statement to end the loop at the appropriate time:</p>


<pre>Repeat indefinitely:
    Get the user's input.
    if the first number is 0:
        Break out of the loop
    Find the value of the expression
    Display the value.</pre>


<p>Getting the user's input involves reading three data values. We need three
variables to store these values. It's best to test whether the first number is
0 right after we read it, so the user will just have to type a 0 to end the
program, not a complete expression such as 0 + 0. "Repeat indefinitely" can be
written as "<span class="code">while (true)</span>":</p>


<pre>while (true):
    Let firstNum = TextIO.getDouble()
    if firstNum is 0:
        Break out of the loop
    Let operator = TextIO.getChar()
    Let secondNum = TextIO.getlnDouble()
    Find the value of the expression
    Display the value.</pre>


<p>To evaluate the user's expression, we have to test the <span class="code">operator</span> to
find out which operation to compute. We can do this with either a multi-way
<span class="code">if</span> statement or with a <span class="code">switch</span> statement. In the program
below, I use a <span class="code">switch</span>. The <span class="code">if</span> statement would be:</p>


<pre>if ( operator == '+' )
   value = firstNum + secondNum;
else if ( operator == '-' )
   value = firstNum - secondNum;
else if ( operator == '*' )
   value = firstNum * secondNum;
else if ( operator == '/' )
   value = firstNum / secondNum;
else {
   TextIO.putln("Unknown operator: " + operator);
   continue;  // back to start of loop
}</pre>


<p>The computer won't let you get away without the <span class="code">else</span> part of the
<span class="code">if</span> statement or the <span class="code">default</span> case in the <span class="code">switch</span>,
since that would leave a possibility that the variable, <span class="code">value</span>, is not
assigned a value before it is printed out.</p>


<p>This program could be improved by having it print out an error message if
the user tries to divide by zero.</p>
