<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>ny type can be used</span> as the base type of an array.
You can have an array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>, an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>, an array
of <span class="classname">Objects</span>, and so on. In particular, since an array type is a
first-class Java type, you can have an array of arrays. For example, an array
of <span class="ptype">ints</span> has type <span class="atype">int[]</span>. This means that there is
automatically another type, <span class="atype">int[][]</span>, which represents an "array of
arrays of <span class="atype">ints</span>". Such an array is said to be a 
<span class="newword">two-dimensional array</span>. Of course once you have the type
<span class="atype">int[][]</span>, there is nothing to stop you from forming the type
<span class="atype">int[][][]</span>, which represents a <span class="newword">three-dimensional array</span> -- and so on. There is no limit on the number of dimensions that
an array type can have. However, arrays of dimension three or higher are fairly
uncommon, and I concentrate here mainly on two-dimensional arrays. The type
<span class="atype">BaseType[][]</span> is usually read "two-dimensional array of
<span class="classname">BaseType</span>" or "<span class="classname">BaseType</span> array array".</p>

</h3>


<p>The declaration statement "<span class="code">int[][] A;</span>" declares a variable named
<span class="code">A</span> of type <span class="atype">int[][]</span>. This variable can hold a reference to an
object of type <span class="atype">int[][]</span>. The assignment statement "<span class="code">A = new
int[3][4];</span>" creates a new two-dimensional array object and sets <span class="code">A</span>
to point to the newly created object. As usual, the declaration and assignment
could be combined in a single declaration statement "<span class="code">int[][] A = new
int[3][4];</span>". The newly created object is an array of
arrays-of-<span class="ptype">ints</span>. The notation <span class="code">int[3][4]</span> indicates that there
are 3 arrays-of-<span class="code">ints</span> in the array <span class="code">A</span>, and that there are 4
<span class="ptype">ints</span> in each array-of-<span class="ptype">ints</span>. However, trying to think in such
terms can get a bit confusing -- as you might have already noticed. So it is
customary to think of a two-dimensional array of items as a rectangular
<span class="newword">grid</span> or <span class="newword">matrix</span> of
items. The notation "<span class="code">new int[3][4]</span>" can then be taken to describe a
grid of <span class="code">ints</span> with 3 rows and 4 columns. The following picture might
help:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="two-dimensional-array.png" width="435" height="325" alt="(Illustration of 3-by-4 array)"></p>



<p>For the most part, you can ignore the reality and keep the picture of a grid
in mind. Sometimes, though, you will need to remember that each row in the grid
is really an array in itself. These arrays can be referred to as <span class="code">A[0]</span>,
<span class="code">A[1]</span>, and <span class="code">A[2]</span>. Each row is in fact a value of type
<span class="atype">int[]</span>. It could, for example, be passed to a subroutine that asks for
a parameter of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>.</p>


<p>The notation <span class="code">A[1]</span> refers to one of the rows of the array
<span class="code">A</span>. Since <span class="code">A[1]</span> is itself an array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>, you can
use another subscript to refer to one of the positions in that row. For
example, <span class="code">A[1][3]</span> refers to item number 3 in row number 1. Keep in
mind, of course, that both rows and columns are numbered starting from zero.
So, in the above example, <span class="code">A[1][3]</span> is 5. More generally,
<span class="code">A[i][j]</span> refers to the grid position in row number <span class="code">i</span> and
column number <span class="code">j</span>. The 12 items in <span class="code">A</span> are named as follows:</p>


<pre>A[0][0]    A[0][1]     A[0][2]     A[0][3]
A[1][0]    A[1][1]     A[1][2]     A[1][3]
A[2][0]    A[2][1]     A[2][2]     A[2][3]</pre>


<p>
<span class="code">A[i][j]</span> is actually a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. You can assign
integer values to it or use it in any other context where an integer variable
is allowed.</p>


<p>It might be worth noting that <span class="code">A.length</span> gives the number of rows of
<span class="code">A</span>. To get the number of columns in <span class="code">A</span>, you have to ask how
many <span class="code">ints</span> there are in a row; this number would be given by
<span class="code">A[0].length</span>, or equivalently by <span class="code">A[1].length</span> or
<span class="code">A[2].length</span>. (There is actually no rule that says that all the rows of
an array must have the same length, and some advanced applications of arrays
use varying-sized rows. But if you use the <span class="code">new</span> operator to create an
array in the manner described above, you'll always get an array with
equal-sized rows.)</p>


<p>Three-dimensional arrays are treated similarly. For example, a
three-dimensional array of <span class="code">ints</span> could be created with the declaration
statement "<span class="code">int[][][] B = new int[7][5][11];</span>". It's possible to
visualize the value of <span class="code">B</span> as a solid 7-by-5-by-11 block of cells. Each
cell holds an <span class="ptype">int</span> and represents one position in the three-dimensional
array. Individual positions in the array can be referred to with variable names of
the form <span class="code">B[i][j][k]</span>. Higher-dimensional arrays follow the same
pattern, although for dimensions greater than three, there is no easy way to
visualize the structure of the array.</p>




<p>It's possible to fill a multi-dimensional array with specified items at the
time it is declared. Recall that when an ordinary one-dimensional array
variable is declared, it can be assigned an "array initializer," which is just
a list of values enclosed between braces, { and }. Array initializers can also
be used when a multi-dimensional array is declared. An initializer for a
two-dimensional array consists of a list of one-dimensional array initializers,
one for each row in the two-dimensional array. For example, the array
<span class="code">A</span> shown in the picture above could be created with:</p>


<pre>int[][]  A  =  {  {  1,  0, 12, -1 },
                  {  7, -3,  2,  5 },
                  { -5, -2,  2, -9 }
               };</pre>


<p>If no initializer is provided for an array, then when the array is created
it is automatically filled with the appropriate value: zero for numbers,
<span class="code">false</span> for boolean, and <span class="code">null</span> for objects.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.5.2">7.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Two-dimensional Arrays</a>
</h3>


<p>Just as in the case of one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays are
often processed using <span class="code">for</span> statements. To process all the items in a
two-dimensional array, you have to use one <span class="code">for</span> statement nested inside
another. If the array <span class="code">A</span> is declared as</p>


<pre>int[][]  A  =  new int[3][4];</pre>


<p>then you could store a zero into each location in <span class="code">A</span> with:</p>


<pre>for (int row = 0;  row &lt; 3;  row++) {
   for (int column = 0;  column &lt; 4;  column++) {
      A[row][column] = 0;
   }
}</pre>


<p>The first time the outer <span class="code">for</span> loop executes (with <span class="code">row</span> = 0),
the inner for loop fills in the four values in the first row of A, namely
<span class="code">A[0][0] = 0</span>, <span class="code">A[0][1] = 0</span>, <span class="code">A[0][2] = 0</span>, and
<span class="code">A[0][3] = 0</span>. The next execution of the outer <span class="code">for</span> loop fills
in the second row of <span class="code">A</span>. And the third and final execution of the outer
loop fills in the final row of <span class="code">A</span>.</p>


<p>Similarly, you could add up all the items in <span class="code">A</span> with:</p>


<pre>int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
   for (int j = 0; j &lt; 4; j++)
      sum = sum + A[i][j];</pre>
   

<p>This could even be done with nested for-each loops.  Keep in mind that
the elements in <span class="code">A</span> are objects of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>,
while the elements in each row of <span class="code">A</span> are of type <span class="ptype">int</span>:</p>
   

<pre>int sum = 0;
for ( int[] row : A ) {       // For each row in A...
   for ( int item : row )     // For each item in that row...
      sum = sum + item;       // Add item to the sum.
}</pre>


<p>To process a three-dimensional array, you would, of course, use triply
nested <span class="code">for</span> loops.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>A two-dimensional array can be used whenever the data that is being represented can
be arranged into rows and columns in a natural way. Often, the grid is built into the
problem. For example, a chess board is a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns. If a
class named <span class="classname">ChessPiece</span> is available to represent individual chess
pieces, then the contents of a chess board could be represented by a
two-dimensional array:</p>


<pre>ChessPiece[][]  board  =  new ChessPiece[8][8];</pre>


<p>Or consider the "mosaic" of colored rectangles used in an example in
<a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;4.6.2</a>. The mosaic is implemented by a class
named <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>. The data
about the color of each of the rectangles in the mosaic is stored in an
instance variable named <span class="code">grid</span> of type <span class="atype">Color[][]</span>. Each position
in this grid is occupied by a value of type <span class="classname">Color</span>. There is one
position in the grid for each colored rectangle in the mosaic. The actual
two-dimensional array is created by the statement:</p>


<pre>grid  =  new Color[ROWS][COLUMNS];</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">ROWS</span> is the number of rows of rectangles in the mosaic and
<span class="code">COLUMNS</span> is the number of columns. The value of the <span class="code">Color</span>
variable <span class="code">grid[i][j]</span> is the color of the rectangle in row number
<span class="code">i</span> and column number <span class="code">j</span>. When the color of that rectangle is
changed to some color, <span class="code">c</span>, the value stored in
<span class="code">grid[i][j]</span> is changed with a statement of the form "<span class="code">grid[i][j] =&nbsp;c;</span>".
When the mosaic is redrawn, the values stored in the two-dimensional
array are used to decide what color to make each rectangle. Here is a
simplified version of the code from the <span class="classname">MosaicCanvas</span> class that draws
all the colored rectangles in the grid. You can see how it uses the array:</p>


<pre>int rowHeight = getHeight() / ROWS;
int colWidth = getWidth() / COLUMNS;
for (int row = 0; row &lt; ROWS; row++) {
   for (int col = 0; col &lt; COLUMNS; col++) {
       <span class="newcode">g.setColor( grid[row][col] ); // Get color from array.</span>
       g.fillRect( col*colWidth, row*rowHeight, 
                                    colWidth, rowHeight );
   }  
}</pre>


<p>Sometimes two-dimensional arrays are used in problems in which the grid is
not so visually obvious. Consider a company that owns 25 stores. Suppose that
the company has data about the profit earned at each store for each month in
the year 2006. If the stores are numbered from 0 to 24, and if the twelve
months from January '06 through December '06 are numbered from 0 to 11, then
the profit data could be stored in an array, <span class="code">profit</span>, constructed as
follows:</p>


<pre>double[][]  profit  =  new double[25][12];</pre>


<p>
<span class="code">profit[3][2]</span> would be the amount of profit earned at store number 3
in March, and more generally, <span class="code">profit[storeNum][monthNum]</span> would be the
amount of profit earned in store number <span class="code">storeNum</span> in month number
<span class="code">monthNum</span>. In this example, the one-dimensional array
<span class="code">profit[storeNum]</span> has a very useful meaning: It is just the profit data
for one particular store for the whole year.</p>


<p>Let's assume that the <span class="code">profit</span> array has already been filled with
data. This data can be processed in a lot of interesting ways. For example, the
total profit for the company -- for the whole year from all its stores -- can
be calculated by adding up all the entries in the array:</p>


<pre>double totalProfit;  // Company's total profit in 2006.

totalProfit = 0;
for (int store = 0; store &lt; 25; store++) {
   for (int month = 0; month &lt; 12; month++)
      totalProfit += profit[store][month];
}</pre>


<p>Sometimes it is necessary to process a single row or a single column of an
array, not the entire array. For example, to compute the total profit earned by
the company in December, that is, in month number 11, you could use the
loop:</p>


<pre>double decemberProfit = 0.0;
for (storeNum = 0; storeNum &lt; 25; storeNum++)
   decemberProfit += profit[storeNum][11];</pre>


<p>Let's extend this idea to create a one-dimensional array that contains the
total profit for each month of the year:</p>


<pre>double[] monthlyProfit;  // Holds profit for each month.
monthlyProfit = new double[12];

for (int month = 0; month &lt; 12; month++) {
   // compute the total profit from all stores in this month.
   monthlyProfit[month] = 0.0;
   for (int store = 0; store &lt; 25; store++) {
         // Add the profit from this store in this month
         // into the total profit figure for the month.
      monthlyProfit[month] += profit[store][month];
   }
}</pre>


<p>As a final example of processing the profit array, suppose that we wanted to
know which store generated the most profit over the course of the year. To do
this, we have to add up the monthly profits for each store. In array terms,
this means that we want to find the sum of each row in the array. As we do
this, we need to keep track of which row produces the largest total.</p>


<pre>double maxProfit; // Maximum profit earned by a store.
int bestStore;    // The number of the store with the
                  //   maximum profit.

double total = 0.0;    // Total profit for one store.
 
// First compute the profit from store number 0.
 
for (int month = 0;  month &lt; 12; month++)
   total += profit[0][month];

bestStore = 0;      // Start by assuming that the best
maxProfit = total;  //     store is store number 0.

// Now, go through the other stores, and whenever we
// find one with a bigger profit than maxProfit, revise
// the assumptions about bestStore and maxProfit.

for (store = 1; store &lt; 25; store++) {
   
    // Compute this store's profit for the year.
   
    total = 0.0;
    for (month = 0; month &lt; 12; month++)
       total += profit[store][month];
      
    // Compare this store's profits with the highest
    // profit we have seen among the preceding stores.
      
    if (total &gt; maxProfit) {
       maxProfit = total;    // Best profit seen so far!
       bestStore = store;    // It came from this store.
    }
   
} // end for

// At this point, maxProfit is the best profit of any
// of the 25 stores, and bestStore is a store that
// generated that profit.  (Note that there could also be
// other stores that generated exactly the same profit.)</pre>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.5.3">7.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Checkers</a>
</h3>



<p>For the rest of this section, we'll look at a more substantial example. We look
at a program that lets two users play checkers against each other. A player
moves by clicking on the piece to be moved and then on the empty square to
which it is to be moved. The squares that the current player can legally click
are hilited. The square containing a piece that has been selected to be moved is surrounded by a
white border. Other pieces that can legally be moved are surrounded by a
cyan-colored border. If a piece has been selected, each empty square that it
can legally move to is hilited with a green border. The game enforces the rule
that if the current player can jump one of the opponent's pieces, then the
player must jump. When a player's piece becomes a king, by reaching the
opposite end of the board, a big white "K" is drawn on the piece.
Here is an applet version of the program:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="Checkers$Applet.class" width="350" height="250" archive="Checkers.jar" alt="(Applet 'Checkers' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>


<p>I will only cover a part of the programming of this applet. I encourage you
to read the complete source code, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Checkers.java">Checkers.java</a></span>. At over 750 lines, this is a more
substantial example than anything you've seen before in this course, but it's
an excellent example of state-based, event-driven programming.</p>


<p>The data about the pieces on the board are stored in a two-dimensional
array. Because of the complexity of the program, I wanted to divide it into
several classes. In addition to the main class, there are several nested classes.
One of these classes is <span class="classname">CheckersData</span>, which handles
the data for the board. It is mainly this class that I want to talk about.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> class has an instance variable named
<span class="code">board</span> of type <span class="code">int[][]</span>. The value of board is set to "<span class="code">new
int[8][8]</span>", an 8-by-8 grid of integers. The values stored in the grid are
defined as constants representing the possible contents of a square on a
checkerboard:</p>


<pre>static final int
          EMPTY = 0,           // Value representing an empty square.
          RED = 1,             // A regular red piece.
          RED_KING = 2,        // A red king.
          BLACK = 3,           // A regular black piece.
          BLACK_KING = 4;      // A black king.</pre>


<p>The constants <span class="code">RED</span> and <span class="code">BLACK</span> are also used in my program
(or, perhaps, misused) to represent the two players in the game. When a game is
started, the values in the variable, <span class="code">board</span>, are set to represent the
initial state of the board. The grid of values looks like</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="checkerboard_contents.png" width="551" height="257" alt="Illustration of initial setup of a checkerboard"></p>


<p>A black piece can only move "down" the grid. That is, the row number of the
square it moves to must be greater than the row number of the square it comes
from. A red piece can only move up the grid. Kings of either color, of course,
can move in both directions.</p>


<p>One function of the <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> class is to take care of all the
details of making moves on the board. An instance method named
<span class="code">makeMove()</span> is provided to do this. When a player moves a piece from
one square to another, the values stored at two positions in the array are
changed. But that's not all. If the move is a jump, then the piece that was
jumped is removed from the board. (The method checks whether the move is a jump
by checking if the square to which the piece is moving is two rows away from
the square where it starts.) Furthermore, a <span class="code">RED</span> piece that moves to
row 0 or a <span class="code">BLACK</span> piece that moves to row 7 becomes a king. This is
good programming: the rest of the program doesn't have to worry about any of
these details. It just calls this <span class="code">makeMove()</span> method:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Make the move from (fromRow,fromCol) to (toRow,toCol).  It is
 * ASSUMED that this move is legal!  If the move is a jump, the
 * jumped piece is removed from the board.  If a piece moves
 * to the last row on the opponent's side of the board, the 
 * piece becomes a king.
 */
void makeMove(int fromRow, int fromCol, int toRow, int toCol) {

   board[toRow][toCol] = board[fromRow][fromCol]; // Move the piece.
   board[fromRow][fromCol] = EMPTY;

   if (fromRow - toRow == 2 || fromRow - toRow == -2) {
         // The move is a jump.  Remove the jumped piece from the board.
      int jumpRow = (fromRow + toRow) / 2; // Row of the jumped piece.
      int jumpCol = (fromCol + toCol) / 2; // Column of the jumped piece.
      board[jumpRow][jumpCol] = EMPTY;
   }

   if (toRow == 0 &amp;&amp; board[toRow][toCol] == RED)
      board[toRow][toCol] = RED_KING;  // Red piece becomes a king.
   if (toRow == 7 &amp;&amp; board[toRow][toCol] == BLACK)
      board[toRow][toCol] = BLACK_KING;  // Black piece becomes a king.

}  // end makeMove()</pre>


<p>An even more important function of the <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> class is to
find legal moves on the board. In my program, a move in a Checkers game is
represented by an object belonging to the following class:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A CheckersMove object represents a move in the game of
 * Checkers.  It holds the row and column of the piece that is 
 * to be moved and the row and column of the square to which 
 * it is to be moved.  (This class makes no guarantee that 
 * the move is legal.)
 */
private static class CheckersMove {
     
   int fromRow, fromCol;  // Position of piece to be moved.
   int toRow, toCol;      // Square it is to move to.
   
   CheckersMove(int r1, int c1, int r2, int c2) {
        // Constructor.  Set the values of the instance variables.
      fromRow = r1;
      fromCol = c1;
      toRow = r2;
      toCol = c2;
   }
   
   boolean isJump() {
        // Test whether this move is a jump.  It is assumed that
        // the move is legal.  In a jump, the piece moves two
        // rows.  (In a regular move, it only moves one row.)
      return (fromRow - toRow == 2 || fromRow - toRow == -2);
   }
   
}  // end class CheckersMove.</pre>


<p>The <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> class has an instance method which finds all the
legal moves that are currently available for a specified player. This method is
a function that returns an array of type <span class="atype">CheckersMove[]</span>. The array
contains all the legal moves, represented as <span class="classname">CheckersMove</span> objects. The
specification for this method reads</p>


<pre>/**
 * Return an array containing all the legal CheckersMoves
 * for the specified player on the current board.  If the player
 * has no legal moves, null is returned.  The value of player
 * should be one of the constants RED or BLACK; if not, null
 * is returned.  If the returned value is non-null, it consists
 * entirely of jump moves or entirely of regular moves, since
 * if the player can jump, only jumps are legal moves.
 */
CheckersMove[] getLegalMoves(int player)</pre>


<p>A brief pseudocode algorithm for the method is</p>


<pre>Start with an empty list of moves
Find any legal jumps and add them to the list
if there are no jumps:
   Find any other legal moves and add them to the list
if the list is empty:
   return null
else:
   return the list</pre>


<p>Now, what is this "list"? We have to return the legal moves in an array. But
since an array has a fixed size, we can't create the array until we know how
many moves there are, and we don't know that until near the end of the method,
after we've already made the list! A neat solution is to use an
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> instead of an array to hold the moves as we find them. 
In fact, I use an object defined by the parameterized type
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;CheckersMove&gt;</span> so that the list is
restricted to holding objects of type <span class="classname">CheckersMove</span>.  As we
add moves to the list, it will grow just as large as necessary. At the end of
the method, we can create the array that we really want and copy the data into
it:</p>


<pre>Let "moves" be an empty ArrayList&lt;CheckerMove&gt;
Find any legal jumps and add them to moves
if moves.size() is 0:
   Find any other legal moves and add them to moves
if moves.size() is 0:
   return null
else:
   Let moveArray be an array of CheckersMoves of length moves.size()
   Copy the contents of moves into moveArray
   return moveArray</pre>


<p>Now, how do we find the legal jumps or the legal moves? The information we
need is in the <span class="code">board</span> array, but it takes some work to extract it. We
have to look through all the positions in the array and find the pieces that
belong to the current player. For each piece, we have to check each square that
it could conceivably move to, and check whether that would be a legal move.
There are four squares to consider. For a jump, we want to look at squares that
are two rows and two columns away from the piece. Thus, the line in the
algorithm that says "Find any legal jumps and add them to moves" expands
to:</p>


<pre>For each row of the board:
   For each column of the board:
      if one of the player's pieces is at this location:
         if it is legal to jump to row + 2, column + 2
             add this move to moves
         if it is legal to jump to row - 2, column + 2
             add this move to moves
         if it is legal to jump to row + 2, column - 2
             add this move to moves
         if it is legal to jump to row - 2, column - 2
             add this move to moves</pre>


<p>The line that says "Find any other legal moves and add them to moves"
expands to something similar, except that we have to look at the four squares
that are one column and one row away from the piece. Testing whether a player
can legally move from one given square to another given square is itself
non-trivial. The square the player is moving to must actually be on the board,
and it must be empty. Furthermore, regular red and black pieces can only move
in one direction. I wrote the following utility method to check whether a
player can make a given non-jump move:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This is called by the getLegalMoves() method to determine 
 * whether the player can legally move from (r1,c1) to (r2,c2).
 * It is ASSUMED that (r1,c1) contains one of the player's 
 * pieces and that (r2,c2) is a neighboring square.
 */
private boolean canMove(int player, int r1, int c1, int r2, int c2) {
      
   if (r2 &lt; 0 || r2 &gt;= 8 || c2 &lt; 0 || c2 &gt;= 8)
      return false;  // (r2,c2) is off the board.
      
   if (board[r2][c2] != EMPTY)
      return false;  // (r2,c2) already contains a piece.

   if (player == RED) {
      if (board[r1][c1] == RED &amp;&amp; r2 &gt; r1)
          return false;  // Regular red piece can only move down.
       return true;  // The move is legal.
   }
   else {
      if (board[r1][c1] == BLACK &amp;&amp; r2 &lt; r1)
          return false;  // Regular black piece can only move up.
       return true;  // The move is legal.
   }
   
}  // end canMove()</pre>


<p>This method is called by my <span class="code">getLegalMoves()</span> method to check whether
one of the possible moves that it has found is actually legal. I have a similar
method that is called to check whether a jump is legal. In this case, I pass to
the method the square containing the player's piece, the square that the player
might move to, and the square between those two, which the player would be
jumping over. The square that is being jumped must contain one of the
opponent's pieces. This method has the specification:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This is called by other methods to check whether
 * the player can legally jump from (r1,c1) to (r3,c3).
 * It is assumed that the player has a piece at (r1,c1), that
 * (r3,c3) is a position that is 2 rows and 2 columns distant
 * from (r1,c1) and that (r2,c2) is the square between (r1,c1)
 * and (r3,c3).
 */
private boolean canJump(int player, int r1, int c1, 
                                   int r2, int c2, int r3, int c3) { . . .</pre>


<p>Given all this, you should be in a position to understand the complete
<span class="code">getLegalMoves()</span> method. It's a nice way to finish off this chapter,
since it combines several topics that we've looked at: one-dimensional arrays,
<span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>, and two-dimensional arrays:</p>


<pre>CheckersMove[] getLegalMoves(int player) {

   if (player != RED &amp;&amp; player != BLACK)
      return null;

   int playerKing;  // The constant for a King belonging to the player.
   if (player == RED)
      playerKing = RED_KING;
   else
      playerKing = BLACK_KING;

   ArrayList&lt;ChecherMove&gt; moves = new ArrayList&lt;CheckerMove&gt;();  
               // Moves will be stored in this list.
   
   /*  First, check for any possible jumps.  Look at each square on
       the board.  If that square contains one of the player's pieces, 
       look at a possible jump in each of the four directions from that 
       square.  If there is a legal jump in that direction, put it in 
       the moves ArrayList.
   */

   for (int row = 0; row &lt; 8; row++) {
      for (int col = 0; col &lt; 8; col++) {
        if (board[row][col] == player || board[row][col] == playerKing) {
            if (canJump(player, row, col, row+1, col+1, row+2, col+2))
