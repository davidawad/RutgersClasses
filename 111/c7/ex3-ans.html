<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.3:</h3>
<p> A <span class="newword">polygon</span> 
is a geometric figure made up of a sequence of
connected line segments. The points where the line segments meet are called the
<span class="newword">vertices</span> of the polygon. The <span class="classname">Graphics</span>
class includes commands for drawing and filling polygons. For these commands,
the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are stored in arrays. If
<span class="code">g</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Graphics</span> then</p>

<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">g.drawPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> will draw the outline of the polygon with vertices at the points
<span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>, <span class="code">(xCoords[1],yCoords[1])</span>, ...,
<span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>. The third parameter,
<span class="code">pointCt</span>, is an <span class="ptype">int</span> that specifies the number of vertices of
the polygon. Its value should be 3 or greater. The first two parameters are
arrays of type <span class="code">int[]</span>. Note that the polygon automatically includes a
line from the last point, <span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>,
back to the starting point <span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">g.fillPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> fills the interior of the polygon with the current drawing
color. The parameters have the same meaning as in the <span class="code">drawPolygon()</span>
method. Note that it is OK for the sides of the polygon to cross each other,
but the interior of a polygon with self-intersections might not be exactly what
you expect.</li>

</ul>

<p>Write a panel class that lets the user draw polygons, and use your panel
as the content pane in an applet (or standalone application).  As the user clicks a
sequence of points, count them and store their x- and y-coordinates in two
arrays. These points will be the vertices of the polygon. Also, draw a line
between each consecutive pair of points to give the user some visual feedback.
When the user clicks near the starting point, draw the complete polygon. Draw
it with a red interior and a black border. The user should then be able to
start drawing a new polygon. When the user shift-clicks on the applet, clear
it.</p>

<p>For this exercise, there is no need to store information about the contents of the 
applet.  Do the drawing directly in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine, and use
the <span class="code">getGraphics()</span> method to get a <span class="classname">Graphics</span> object
that you can use to draw the line.  (Remember, though, that this is considered to be
bad style.)  You will not need a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, since
the default action of filling the panel with its background color is good
enough.</p>


<p>You can try my solution here. Note that as the user is drawing the polygon, lines
are drawn between the points that the user clicks. Click within two pixels of
the starting point to see a filled polygon.</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="SimplePolygons.class" width="300" height="300" archive="SimplePolygons.jar" alt="Applet 'SimplePolygons' should appear here."></applet></p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>For my solution, I wrote a subclass of <span class="classname">JApplet</span>
and used a nested class named <span class="classname">Display</span> to represent the panel
on which the drawing is done. The
only method in the main class is the <span class="code">init()</span> method, which creates the
drawing surface of type <span class="classname">Display</span>and uses it as the content pane of the applet.
My discussion here is about <span class="classname">Display</span>.</p>


<p>The program needs several instance variables to store information about the
sequence of points that the user has clicked:</p>


<pre>int[] xCoord, yCoord;  // Arrays to hold he coordinates.
int pointCt;           // Number of points in the arrays.</pre>


<p>The arrays <span class="code">xCoord</span> and <span class="code">yCoord</span> are examples of "partially
full arrays", as covered in <a href="../c7/s3.html#arrays.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;7.3.1</a>. The variable
<span class="code">pointCt</span> keeps track of how many spaces in the array are used. 
There are, of course, other ways to represent the data, such as using a single
array of <span class="classname">Point</span>, or using an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
However, the statement of the problem asked for two arrays.
The instance variables are initialized in the constructor of the <span class="code">Display</span>
with the commands:</p>


<pre>xCoord = new int[500];
yCoord = new int[500];
pointCt = 0;</pre>


<p>The size of the arrays allows for polygons with up to 500 vertices, which
should certainly be enough. When we start, there are not yet any points in the
array, so <span class="code">pointCt</span> is zero. (The command to set <span class="code">pointCt</span> to
zero is not really necessary, since <span class="code">pointCt</span>, as an instance variable,
is automatically initialized to zero in any case. However, including this
command seemed to me to make my intentions clearer to the reader. That should
always be a consideration.)</p>


<p>In my solution, I included a method to draw a line and a method to
draw a polygon. These methods are called in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span>
routine. Since the lines and polygons are drawn directly, rather than in the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, these methods are responsible for
obtaining graphics contexts to do the drawing. The <span class="code">putLine</span> method is
simple:</p>


<pre>private void putLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
       // Draw a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) directly onto this
       // component, without going through the paintComponent() 
       // method.
    Graphics g = getGraphics();
    g.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2);
    g.dispose();
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">putPolygon()</span> method uses the data for the polygon that is
stored in the instance variables <span class="code">xCoord</span>, <span class="code">yCoord</span>, and
<span class="code">pointCt</span>. It is complicated a little by the fact that three points are
required to draw a polygon. If there are only two points stored in the arrays,
then I just draw a line between the two points. Note that the two points are
stored in the first two locations in the <span class="code">xCoord</span> and <span class="code">yCoord</span>
arrays. The coordinates of the two points are <span class="code">(xCoord[0],yCoord[0])</span>
and <span class="code">(xCoord[1],yCoord[1])</span>. If there are fewer than two points, I don't
draw anything. If there are three or more points, then I first draw the
interior of the polygon in red and then draw the outline of the polygon in
black:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Draw the polygon described by the arrays xCoord and yCoord
 * and the integer pointCt.  A filled polygon with a black 
 * outline is drawn.  If pointCt is 0 or 1, nothing is drawn.
 * If pointCt is 2, only a black line is drawn.
 */
private void putPolygon() {
   if (pointCt &lt; 2)
      return;
   Graphics g = getGraphics();
   if (pointCt == 2) {
      g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      g.drawLine(xCoord[0], yCoord[0], xCoord[1], yCoord[1]);
   }
   else {
      g.setColor(polygonColor);  // (polygonColor has value Color.RED)
      g.fillPolygon(xCoord, yCoord, pointCt);
      g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      g.drawPolygon(xCoord, yCoord, pointCt);
   }
   g.dispose();
}</pre>


<p>The main logic of the applet is in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method. An
algorithm for this method is:</p>


<pre>if the user was holding down the Shift key:
    Clear the applet, and start a new polygon
else if the user clicked near the first point:
    Draw the current polygon and start a new one
else
    Add the point (evt.getX(), evt.getY()) to the coordinate arrays
    if this is not the first point in the arrays:
        Draw a line between the previous point and this one</pre>


<p>Actually, in my solution, I decided to add another case: If the user
right-clicks the applet or if the number of points reaches 500, then I draw the
current polygon and start a new one. Also, there is a <b>bug</b> in the algorithm as
stated, where it tests "if the user clicked near the first point". This test
doesn't make sense unless there actually is a first point, that is unless
<span class="code">pointCt</span> is greater than zero. The test should really read "if
<span class="code">pointCt</span> &gt; 0 and if the user clicked near
<span class="code">(xCoord[0],yCoord[0])</span>."</p>


<p>Where the algorithm says "start a new polygon", it is only necessary to say
"<span class="code">pointCt = 0;</span>" since that will indicate that the coordinate arrays
contain no valid data. The command "draw the current polygon" can be translated
as "<span class="code">putPolygon()</span>". Adding a point to the coordinate arrays means
putting the coordinates of the point in the next available location of the
arrays and incrementing <span class="code">pointCt</span> to record the fact that the number of
valid data in the arrays has increased by one. This is done with the
commands</p>


<pre>xCoord[pointCt] = evt.getX();
yCoord[pointCt] = evt.getY();
pointCt++;</pre>


<p>Then, if <span class="code">pointCt</span> is greater than 1, we have to draw a line between
the last two points in the array. The coordinates of these points are
<span class="code">(xCoord[pointCt-2],yCoord[pointCt-2])</span> and
<span class="code">(xCoord[pointCt-1],yCoord[pointCt-1])</span>, so this can be done with the
command</p>


<pre>putLine(xCoord[pointCt-2], yCoord[pointCt-2],
                 xCoord[pointCt-1], yCoord[pointCt-1] );</pre>


<p>The only thing in the algorithm that still needs implementing is to test
whether the user clicks "near the starting point". The starting point has
coordinates <span class="code">(xCoord[0],yCoord[0])</span> and the point where the user clicked
has coordinates <span class="code">(evt.getX(),evt.getY())</span>. In my applet, I check whether
the <span class="code">x</span>-coordinates of these points are two pixels or less apart and the
<span class="code">y</span>-coordinates are also two pixels or less apart. This is done by
checking whether "<span class="code">Math.abs(xCoord[0] - evt.getX()) &lt;= 2 &amp;&amp;
Math.abs(yCoord[0] - evt.getY()) &lt;= 2</span>". If you are uncomfortable with
absolute values, you can use the equivalent test "<span class="code">(evt.getX() - 2 &lt;=
xCoords[0]) &amp;&amp; (xCoords[0] &lt;= evt.getX() + 2) &amp;&amp; (evt.getY()
- 2 &lt;= yCoords[0]) &amp;&amp; (yCoords[0] &lt;= evt.getY() + 2)</span>".</p>


<p>The complete program for the applet is shown below.</p>


<p>(By the way, there are versions of the <span class="code">drawPolygon()</span> and
<span class="code">fillPolygon()</span> methods that work with objects belonging to a class
called <span class="code">Polygon</span>, instead of with arrays. So, you don't absolutely need
arrays to work with polygons.)</p>
