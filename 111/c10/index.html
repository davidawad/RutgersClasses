<span class="start"><big>H</big>ow to avoid reinventing</span> the wheel? Many data
structures and algorithms, such as those from <a href="../c9/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>, have been
studied, programmed, and re-programmed by generations of computer science
students. This is a valuable learning experience. Unfortunately, they have also
been programmed and re-programmed by generations of working computer
professionals, taking up time that could be devoted to new, more creative work.
A programmer who needs a list or a binary tree shouldn't have to re-code these
data structures from scratch. They are well-understood and have been programmed
thousands of times before. The problem is how to make pre-written, robust data
structures available to programmers. In this chapter, we'll look at Java's
attempt to address this problem.</p>
