<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.1:</h3>
<p>In the <span class="classname">SimpleStamperPanel</span> example from
<a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.2</a>, a rectangle or oval is drawn on the panel when
the user clicks the mouse, except that when the user shift-clicks, the panel is cleared
instead.  Modify this class so that the modified version will continue to draw figures as the user
drags the mouse.  That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures as the user
drags the mouse.  However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be
cleared and no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after
shift-clicking. Use your panel either in an applet or in a stand-alone application
(or both).  Here is an applet version of my solution:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="SimpleStamperAppletWithDrag.class" width="350" height="250" archive="SimpleStamperWithDrag.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<p>The source code for the original panel class is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamperPanel.java">SimpleStamperPanel.java</a></span>.
An applet that uses this class can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamperApplet.java">SimpleStamperApplet.java</a></span>,
and a main program that uses the panel in a frame is in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleStamper.java">SimpleStamper.java</a></span>.
See the discussion of dragging in <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>.
(Note that in the original version, I drew a black outline around each shape.
In the modified version, I decided that it would look better to draw a gray
outline instead.)</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.2:</h3>
<p>Write a panel that shows a small red square and a small blue
square. The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse.
(You'll need an instance variable to remember which square the user is
dragging.) The user can drag the square off the applet if she wants; if she
does this, it's gone. Use your panel in either an applet or a stand-alone application.
You can try the applet version here:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.3:</h3>
<p>Write a panel that shows
a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel, the dice should be rolled
(that is, the dice should be assigned newly computed random values). Each die
should be drawn as a square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw
two dice, its a good idea to write a subroutine, "<span class="code">void drawDie(Graphics g,
int val, int x, int y)</span>", to draw a die at the specified <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
coordinates. The second parameter, <span class="code">val</span>, specifies the value that is
showing on the die. Assume that the size of the panel is 100 by 100 pixels.
Also write an applet that uses your panel as its content pane.
Here is a working version of the applet:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.4:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>,
you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dice are rolled when the user clicks on
the panel Now make a pair-of-dice program in which the user rolls the
dice by clicking a button.  The button should appear under the
panel that shows the dice.  Also make the following change:  When the
dice are rolled, instead of just showing the new value, show a short animation
during which the values on the dice are changed in every frame.  The animation
is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually rolling.
Write your program as a stand-alone application. Here is an applet version of 
the program:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.5:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c3/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.6</a>, you drew a checkerboard. For this
exercise, write a checkerboard applet where the user can select a square by
clicking on it. Hilite the selected square by drawing a colored border around
it. When the applet is first created, no square is selected. When the user
clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected. If the
user clicks the square that is selected, it becomes unselected. Assume that the
size of the applet is exactly 160 by 160 pixels, so that each square on the
checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. 
Here is a working version of the applet:</p>

<p align="center">

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.6:</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you
should modify the SubKiller game from <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.5.4</a>. You
can start with the existing source code, from the file 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SubKillerPanel.java">SubKillerPanel.java</a></span>. Modify the game so it
keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities.
That is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes
up by one. Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom of the screen
without hitting the sub, the number of misses goes up by one. There is room at
the top of the panel to display these numbers. To do this exercise, you only
have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. But you have to figure out
what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have to read the source
code closely enough to understand how it works.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.7:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a> involved a class, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>,
that could compute some statistics
of a set of numbers. Write a program that uses the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to
compute and display statistics of numbers entered by the user. The panel will
have an instance variable of type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that does the computations.
The panel should include a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> where the user enters a number.
It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that
have been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard
deviation. Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on
the labels should change. The user enters a number by typing it into the
<span class="classname">JTextField</span> and pressing return. There should be a "Clear" button that
clears out all the data. This means creating a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and
resetting the displays on the labels. My panel also has an "Enter" button that
does the same thing as pressing the return key in the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
(Recall that a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> generates an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span> when the
user presses return, so your panel should register itself to listen for
<span class="classname">ActionEvents</span> from the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.)
Write your program as a stand-alone application.  Here is an applet version of my solution to
this problem:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.8:</h3>
<p> Write a panel with a
<span class="classname">JTextArea</span> where the user can enter some text. The panel should have a
button. When the user clicks on the button, the panel should count the number
of lines in the user's input, the number of words in the user's input, and the
number of characters in the user's input. This information should be displayed
on three labels in the panel. Recall that if <span class="code">textInput</span> is a
<span class="classname">JTextArea</span>, then you can get the contents of the <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> by
calling the function <span class="code">textInput.getText()</span>. This function returns a
<span class="classname">String</span> containing all the text from the text area. The number
of characters is just the length of this <span class="classname">String</span>. Lines in the
<span class="classname">String</span> are separated by the new line character, <span class="code">'\n'</span>, so the number of
lines is just the number of new line characters in the <span class="classname">String</span>, plus
one. Words are a little harder to count. <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a> 
has some advice about finding the
words in a <span class="classname">String</span>. Essentially, you want to count the number of
characters that are first characters in words. Don't forget to put your
<span class="classname">JTextArea</span> in a <span class="classname">JScrollPane</span>,
and add the scroll pane to the container, not the text area. Scrollbars should appear when the
user types more text than will fit in the available area. Here is an
applet version of my solution:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.9:</h3>
<p>Write a Blackjack program
that lets the user play a game of Blackjack, with the computer as the dealer.
The applet should draw the user's cards and the dealer's cards, just as was
done for the graphical HighLow card game in  <a href="../c6/s7.html#GUI1.7.6">Subsection&nbsp;6.7.6</a>.
You can use the source code for that game, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/HighLowGUI.java">HighLowGUI.java</a></span>, for some ideas about how to
write your Blackjack game. The structures of the HighLow panel and the
Blackjack panel are very similar. You will certainly want to use the
<span class="code">drawCard()</span> method from the HighLow program.</p>


<p>You can find a description of the game of Blackjack in <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>. 
Add the following rule to that
description: If a player takes five cards without going over 21, that player
wins immediately. This rule is used in some casinos. For your program, it means
that you only have to allow room for five cards. You should assume that the
panel is just wide enough to show five cards, and that it is tall enough 
show the user's hand and the dealer's hand.</p>


<p>Note that the design of a GUI Blackjack game is very different from the
design of the text-oriented program that you wrote for <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>. The user
should play the game by clicking on "Hit" and "Stand" buttons. There should be
a "New Game" button that can be used to start another game after one game ends.
You have to decide what happens when each of these buttons is pressed. You
don't have much chance of getting this right unless you think in terms of the
states that the game can be in and how the state can change.</p>


<p>Your program will need the classes defined in 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, and
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.</p>



<p>Here is an applet version of the program for you to try:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="BlackjackGUI$Applet.class" width="466" height="346" archive="BlackjackGUI.jar" alt=""></applet></p>


<p align="right">
<a href="ex9-ans.html">See the Solution</a>
</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.10:</h3>
<p>In the Blackjack game 
from <a href="../c6/ex9-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.9</a>, the user can click on the "Hit",
"Stand", and "NewGame" buttons even when it doesn't make sense to do so. It
would be better if the buttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The "New
Game" button should be disabled when there is a game in progress. The "Hit" and
"Stand" buttons should be disabled when there is not a game in progress. The
instance variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> tells whether or not a game is in
progress, so you just have to make sure that the buttons are properly enabled
and disabled whenever this variable changes value. 
I strongly advise writing a subroutine that can be called whenever it is
necessary to set the value of the <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variable. Then the
subroutine can take responsibility for enabling and disabling the buttons.
Recall that if <span class="code">bttn</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">JButton</span>, then
<span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(false)</span> disables the button and
<span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(true)</span> enables the button.</p>


<p>As a second (and more difficult) improvement, make it possible
for the user to place bets on the Blackjack game. When the applet starts, give
the user $100. Add a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> to the strip of controls along the
bottom of the applet. The user can enter the bet in this <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. You should do this when the
game begins, not when it ends, because several errors can occur: The contents
of the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> might not be a legal number. The bet that the user
places might be more money than the user has, or it might be &lt;= 0. You
should detect these errors and show an error message instead of starting the
game. The user's bet should be an integral number of dollars.</p>


<p>It would be a good idea to make the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> uneditable while the
game is in progress. If <span class="code">betInput</span> is the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, you can
make it editable and uneditable by the user with the commands
<span class="code">betInput.setEditable(true)</span> and <span class="code">betInput.setEditable(false)</span>.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, you should include commands to
display the amount of money that the user has left.</p>


<p>There is one other thing to think about: Ideally, the applet should not start a new
game when it is first created. The user should have a chance to set a bet
amount before the game starts. So, in the constructor for the drawing surface class, you
should not call <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>. You might want to display a message such
as "Welcome to Blackjack" before the first game starts.</p>
