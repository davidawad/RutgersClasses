<span class="start"><big>A</big>lthough the basic ideas</span> of object-oriented
programming are reasonably simple and clear, they are subtle, and they take
time to get used to. And unfortunately, beyond the basic ideas there are a lot
of details. This section and the <a href="../c5/s7.html">next</a> cover more of those
annoying details. You should not necessarily master everything in these two
sections the first time through, but you should read it to be aware of what is
possible. For the most part, when I need to use this material later in the
text, I will explain it again briefly, or I will refer you back to it. In this
section, we'll look at two variables, <span class="code">this</span> and <span class="code">super</span>, that are
automatically defined in any instance method.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.6.1">5.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Variable this</a>
</h3>



<p>A static member of a class has a simple name, which can only be used inside
the class definition. For use outside the class, it has a full name of the form
<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">simple-name</span>. For example, "<span class="code">System.out</span>" is a static
member variable with simple name "<span class="code">out</span>" in the class "<span class="classname">System</span>".
It's always legal to use the full name of a static member, even within the
class where it's defined. Sometimes it's even necessary, as when the simple
name of a static member variable is hidden by a local variable of the same
name.</p>


<p>Instance variables and instance methods also have simple names. The simple
name of such an instance member can be used in instance methods in the class
where the instance member is defined. Instance members also have full names,
but remember that instance variables and methods are actually contained in
objects, not classes. The full name of an instance member has to contain a
reference to the object that contains the instance member. To get at an
instance variable or method from outside the class definition, you need a
variable that refers to the object. Then the full name is of the form
<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>.<span class="bnf">simple-name</span>. But suppose you are writing the definition of
an instance method in some class. How can you get a reference to the object
that contains that instance method? You might need such a reference, for
example, if you want to use the full name of an instance variable, because the
simple name of the instance variable is hidden by a local variable or
parameter.</p>


<p>Java provides a special, predefined variable named "<span class="code">this</span>" that you
can use for such purposes. The variable, <span class="code">this</span>, is used in the source
code of an instance method to refer to the object that contains the method.
This intent of the name, <span class="code">this</span>, is to refer to "this object," the one
right here that this very method is in. If <span class="code">x</span> is an instance variable
in the same object, then <span class="code">this.x</span> can be used as a full name for that
variable. If <span class="code">otherMethod()</span> is an instance method in the same object,
then <span class="code">this.otherMethod()</span> could be used to call that method. Whenever
the computer executes an instance method, it automatically sets the variable,
<span class="code">this</span>, to refer to the object that contains the method.</p>


<p>One common use of <span class="code">this</span> is in constructors. For example:</p>


<pre>public class Student {

    private String name;  // Name of the student.
    
    public Student(String name) {
         // Constructor.  Create a student with specified name.
       this.name = name;
    }
      .
      .   // More variables and methods.
      .
}</pre>


<p>In the constructor, the instance variable called <span class="code">name</span> is hidden by
a formal parameter. However, the instance variable can still be referred to by
its full name, <span class="code">this.name</span>. In the assignment statement, the value of
the formal parameter, <span class="code">name</span>, is assigned to the instance variable,
<span class="code">this.name</span>. This is considered to be acceptable style: There is no need
to dream up cute new names for formal parameters that are just used to
initialize instance variables. You can use the same name for the parameter as
for the instance variable.</p>


<p>There are other uses for <span class="code">this</span>. Sometimes, when you are writing an
instance method, you need to pass the object that contains the method to a
subroutine, as an actual parameter. In that case, you can use <span class="code">this</span> as
the actual parameter. For example, if you wanted to print out a string
representation of the object, you could say
"<span class="code">System.out.println(this);</span>". Or you could assign the value of
<span class="code">this</span> to another variable in an assignment statement. In fact, you can
do anything with <span class="code">this</span> that you could do with any other variable,
except change its value.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.6.2">5.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Variable super</a>
</h3>


<p>Java also defines another special variable, named "<span class="code">super</span>", for use
in the definitions of instance methods. The variable <span class="code">super</span> is for use
in a subclass. Like <span class="code">this</span>, <span class="code">super</span> refers to the object that
contains the method. But it's forgetful. It forgets that the object belongs to
the class you are writing, and it remembers only that it belongs to the
superclass of that class. The point is that the class can contain additions and
modifications to the superclass. <span class="code">super</span> doesn't know about any of those
additions and modifications; it can only be used to refer to methods and
variables in the superclass.</p>


<p>Let's say that the class that you are writing contains an instance method
named <span class="code">doSomething()</span>. Consider the subroutine call statement
<span class="code">super.doSomething()</span>. Now, <span class="code">super</span> doesn't know anything about
the <span class="code">doSomething()</span> method in the subclass. It only knows about things
in the superclass, so it tries to execute a method named <span class="code">doSomething()</span>
from the superclass. If there is none -- if the <span class="code">doSomething()</span> method
was an addition rather than a modification -- you'll get a syntax error.</p>


<p>The reason <span class="code">super</span> exists is so you can get access to things in the
superclass that are <b>hidden</b> by things in the subclass. For example,
<span class="code">super.x</span> always refers to an instance variable named <span class="code">x</span> in the
superclass. This can be useful for the following reason: If a class contains an
instance variable with the same name as an instance variable in its superclass,
then an object of that class will actually contain two variables with the same
name: one defined as part of the class itself and one defined as part of the
superclass. The variable in the subclass does not <b>replace</b> the
variable of the same name in the superclass; it merely <span class="newword">hides</span>
it. The variable from the superclass can still be accessed, using
<span class="code">super</span>.</p>


<p>When you write a method in a subclass that has the same signature as a
method in its superclass, the method from the superclass is hidden in the same
way. We say that the method in the subclass <span class="newword">overrides</span> 
the method from the superclass. Again, however,
<span class="code">super</span> can be used to access the method from the superclass.</p>


<p>The major use of <span class="code">super</span> is to override a method with a new method
that <b>extends</b> the behavior of the inherited method, instead of
<b>replacing</b> that behavior entirely. The new method can use
<span class="code">super</span> to call the method from the superclass, and then it can add
additional code to provide additional behavior. As an example, suppose you have
a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class that includes a <span class="code">roll()</span> method. Suppose
that you want a subclass, <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span>, to represent a pair of dice
drawn on the computer screen. The <span class="code">roll()</span> method in the
<span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> class should do everything that the <span class="code">roll()</span>
method in the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class does. We can express this with a call
to <span class="code">super.roll()</span>, which calls the method in the superclass. 
But in addition to that, the <span class="code">roll()</span> method
for a <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> object has to redraw the dice to show the new
values. The <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> class might look something like this:</p>


<pre>public class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice {

    public void roll() {
            // Roll the dice, and redraw them.
         super.roll();  // Call the roll method from PairOfDice.
         redraw();      // Call a method to draw the dice.
    }
       .
       .  // More stuff, including definition of redraw().
       .
}</pre>


<p>Note that this allows you to extend the behavior of the <span class="code">roll()</span>
method even if you don't know how the method is implemented in the
superclass!</p>


<p>Here is a more complete example. The applet at the end of 
<a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a>
 shows a disturbance that moves around in a
mosaic of little squares. As it moves, each square that it visits becomes a brighter
shade of red. The result looks interesting, but I think it would be prettier if the
pattern were symmetric. A symmetric version of the applet is shown at the
bottom of <a href="../c5/s7.html">Section&nbsp;5.7</a>. The symmetric applet can be
programmed as an easy extension of the original applet.</p>


<p>In the
symmetric version, each time a square is brightened, the squares that can be
obtained from that one by horizontal and vertical reflection through the center
of the mosaic are also brightened.  This picture might make the symmetry
idea clearer:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="symmetricPixels.gif" width="200" height="140" alt=""></p>


<p>The four red squares in the picture, for
example, form a set of such symmetrically placed squares, as do the purple
squares and the green squares. (The blue square is at the center of the mosaic,
so reflecting it doesn't produce any other squares; it's its own
reflection.)</p>


<p>The original applet is defined by the class <span class="classname">RandomBrighten</span>.
In that class, the actual task of brightening a square is done by a method called
<span class="code">brighten()</span>. If <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> are the row and column
numbers of a square, then "<span class="code">brighten(row,col);</span>" increases the
brightness of that square. All we need is a subclass of <span class="classname">RandomBrighten</span>
with a modified <span class="code">brighten()</span> routine. Instead of just brightening one
square, the modified routine will also brighten the horizontal and vertical
reflections of that square. But how will it brighten each of the four
individual squares? By calling the <span class="code">brighten()</span> method from the original
class. It can do this by calling <span class="code">super.brighten()</span>.</p>


<p>There is still the problem of computing the row and column numbers of the
horizontal and vertical reflections. To do this, you need to know the number of
rows and the number of columns. The <span class="classname">RandomBrighten</span> class has instance
variables named <span class="code">ROWS</span> and <span class="code">COLUMNS</span> to represent these
quantities. Using these variables, it's possible to come up with formulas for
the reflections, as shown in the definition of the <span class="code">brighten()</span> method
below.</p>


<p>Here's the complete definition of the new class:</p>


<pre>public class SymmetricBrighten extends RandomBrighten {

   void brighten(int row, int col) {
         // Brighten the specified square and its horizontal
         // and vertical reflections.  This overrides the brighten 
         // method from the RandomBrighten class, which just 
         // brightens one square.
      super.brighten(row, col);
      super.brighten(ROWS - 1 - row, col);
      super.brighten(row, COLUMNS - 1 - col);
      super.brighten(ROWS - 1 - row, COLUMNS - 1 - col);
   }

} // end class SymmetricBrighten</pre>


<p>This is the entire source code for the applet!</p>
   



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.6.3">5.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Constructors in Subclasses</a>
</h3>


<p>Constructors are not inherited. That is, if you extend an existing class to
make a subclass, the constructors in the superclass do <span class="code">not</span> become part
of the subclass. If you want constructors in the subclass, you have to define
new ones from scratch. If you don't define any constructors in the subclass,
then the computer will make up a default constructor, with no parameters, for
you.</p>


<p>This could be a problem, if there is a constructor in the superclass that
does a lot of necessary work. It looks like you might have to repeat all that
work in the subclass! This could be a <b>real</b> problem if you
don't have the source code to the superclass, and don't know how it works, or
if the constructor in the superclass initializes <span class="code">private</span> member
variables that you don't even have access to in the subclass!</p>


<p>Obviously, there has to be some fix for this, and there is. It involves the
special variable, <span class="code">super</span>. As the very first statement in a constructor,
you can use <span class="code">super</span> to call a constructor from the superclass. The
notation for this is a bit ugly and misleading, and it can only be used in this
one particular circumstance: It looks like you are calling <span class="code">super</span> as a
subroutine (even though <span class="code">super</span> is not a subroutine and you can't call
constructors the same way you call other subroutines anyway). As an example,
assume that the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class has a constructor that takes two
integers as parameters. Consider a subclass:</p>


<pre>public class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice {

     public GraphicalDice() {  // Constructor for this class.
     
         super(3,4);  // Call the constructor from the
                      //   PairOfDice class, with parameters 3, 4.
                      
         initializeGraphics();  // Do some initialization specific
                                //   to the GraphicalDice class.
     }
        .
        .  // More constructors, methods, variables...
        .
}</pre>


<p>The statement "<span class="code">super(3,4);</span>" calls the constructor from
the superclass.  This call must be the first line of the constructor in the
subclass.  Note that if you don't explicitly call a constructor from the
superclass in this way, then the default constructor from the superclass, the one with
no parameters, will be called automatically.</p>
   

<p>This might seem rather technical, but unfortunately it is sometimes
necessary. By the way, you can use the special variable <span class="code">this</span> in
exactly the same way to call another constructor in the same class. This can be
useful since it can save you from repeating the same code in several
constructors.</p>
