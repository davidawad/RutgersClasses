<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he ability of a computer to perform</span> complex tasks
is built on just a few ways of combining simple commands into control
structures. In Java, there are just six such structures that are used to determine the normal
flow of control in a program -- and, in fact, just
three of them would be enough to write programs to perform any task. The six
control structures are: the <span class="newword">block</span>, the
<span class="newword">while loop</span>, the <span class="newword">do..while loop</span>, the 
<span class="newword">for loop</span>, the <span class="newword">if statement</span>, and the 
<span class="newword">switch statement</span>.  Each of these structures is considered to be a single
"statement," but each is in fact a <b>structured</b> statement that
can contain one or more other statements inside itself.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.1.1">3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocks</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="newword">block</span> is the simplest type of structured
statement. Its purpose is simply to group a sequence of statements into a
single statement. The format of a block is:</p>


<pre>{
     <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>That is, it consists of a sequence of statements enclosed between a pair of
braces, "{" and "}". (In fact, it is possible for a block to contain no
statements at all; such a block is called an <span class="newword">empty block</span>, 
and can actually be useful at times. An empty block consists of
nothing but an empty pair of braces.) Block statements usually occur inside
other statements, where their purpose is to group together several statements
into a unit. However, a block can be legally used wherever a statement can
occur. There is one place where a block is required: As you might have already
noticed in the case of the <span class="code">main</span> subroutine of a program, the
definition of a subroutine is a block, since it is a sequence of statements
enclosed inside a pair of braces.</p>


<p>I should probably note again at this point that Java is what is called a
free-format language. There are no syntax rules about how the language has to
be arranged on a page. So, for example, you could write an entire block on one
line if you want. But as a matter of good programming style, you should lay out
your program on the page in a way that will make its structure as clear as
possible. In general, this means putting one statement per line and using
indentation to indicate statements that are contained inside control
structures. This is the format that I will generally use in my examples.</p>


<p>Here are two examples of blocks:</p>


<pre>{
   System.out.print("The answer is ");
   System.out.println(ans);
}
  
 
{  // This block exchanges the values of x and y
   int temp;      // A temporary variable for use in this block.
   temp = x;      // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.
   x = y;         // Copy the value of y into x.
   y = temp;      // Copy the value of temp into y.
}</pre>


<p>In the second example, a variable, <span class="code">temp</span>, is declared inside the
block. This is perfectly legal, and it is good style to declare a variable
inside a block if that variable is used nowhere else but inside the block. A
variable declared inside a block is completely inaccessible and invisible from
outside that block. When the computer executes the variable declaration
statement, it allocates memory to hold the value of the variable. When the
block ends, that memory is discarded (that is, made available for reuse). The
variable is said to be <span class="newword">local</span> to the block. There
is a general concept called the "scope" of an identifier. The <span class="newword">scope</span> 
of an identifier is the part of the program in which
that identifier is valid. The scope of a variable defined inside a block is
limited to that block, and more specifically to the part of the block that
comes after the declaration of the variable.</p>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.1.2">3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic While Loop</a>
</h3>


<p>The block statement by itself really doesn't affect the flow of control in a
program. The five remaining control structures do. They can be divided into two
classes: loop statements and branching statements. You really just need one
control structure from each category in order to have a completely
general-purpose programming language. More than that is just convenience. In
this section, I'll introduce the <span class="code">while</span> loop and the <span class="code">if</span>
statement. I'll give the full details of these statements and of the other
three control structures in later sections.</p>


<p>A <span class="newword">while loop</span> is used to repeat a given
statement over and over. Of course, it's not likely that you would want to keep
repeating it forever. That would be an <span class="newword">infinite loop</span>, which is 
generally a bad thing. (There is an old story about
computer pioneer Grace Murray Hopper, who read instructions on a bottle of
shampoo telling her to "lather, rinse, repeat." As the story goes, she claims
that she tried to follow the directions, but she ran out of shampoo. (In case
you don't get it, this is a joke about the way that computers mindlessly follow
instructions.))</p>


<p>To be more specific, a <span class="code">while</span> loop will repeat a statement over and
over, but only so long as a specified condition remains true. A <span class="code">while</span>
loop has the form:</p>


<pre>while (<span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>)
     <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>Since the statement can be, and usually is, a block, many <span class="code">while</span>
loops have the form:</p>


<pre>while (<span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>The semantics of this statement go like this: When the computer comes to a
<span class="code">while</span> statement, it evaluates the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>, which yields either <span class="code">true</span> or
<span class="code">false</span> as the value. If the value is <span class="code">false</span>, the computer skips
over the rest of the <span class="code">while</span> loop and proceeds to the next command in
the program. If the value of the expression is <span class="code">true</span>, the computer
executes the <span class="bnf">statement</span> or block of <span class="bnf">statements</span> inside the loop. Then it returns to the
beginning of the <span class="code">while</span> loop and repeats the process. That is, it
re-evaluates the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>, ends the
loop if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, and continues it if the value is
<span class="code">true</span>. This will continue over and over until the value of the
expression is <span class="code">false</span>; if that never happens, then there will be an
infinite loop.</p>


<p>Here is an example of a <span class="code">while</span> loop that simply prints out the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:</p>


<pre>int number;   // The number to be printed.
number = 1;   // Start with 1.
while ( number &lt; 6 ) {  // Keep going as long as number is &lt; 6.
    System.out.println(number);
    number = number + 1;  // Go on to the next number.
}
System.out.println("Done!");</pre>


<p>The variable <span class="code">number</span> is initialized with the value&nbsp;1. So the first
time through the <span class="code">while</span> loop, when the computer evaluates the
expression "<span class="code">number&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6</span>", it is asking whether 1 is less than 6, which is
<span class="code">true</span>. The computer therefore proceeds to execute the two statements
inside the loop. The first statement prints out "1". The second statement adds
1 to <span class="code">number</span> and stores the result back into the variable
<span class="code">number</span>; the value of <span class="code">number</span> has been changed to 2. The
computer has reached the end of the loop, so it returns to the beginning and
asks again whether <span class="code">number</span> is less than 6. Once again this is true, so
the computer executes the loop again, this time printing out 2 as the value of
<span class="code">number</span> and then changing the value of <span class="code">number</span> to 3. It
continues in this way until eventually <span class="code">number</span> becomes equal to 6. At
that point, the expression "<span class="code">number&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6</span>" evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>. So, the
computer jumps past the end of the loop to the next statement and prints out
the message "Done!". Note that when the loop ends, the value of <span class="code">number</span>
is 6, but the last value that was printed was 5.</p>


<p>By the way, you should remember that you'll never see a <span class="code">while</span> loop
standing by itself in a real program. It will always be inside a subroutine
which is itself defined inside some class. As an example of a <span class="code">while</span>
loop used inside a complete program, here is a little program that computes the
interest on an investment over several years. This is an improvement over
examples from the previous chapter that just reported the results for one
year:</p>


<pre>public class Interest3 {
     
   /*
      This class implements a simple program that
      will compute the amount of interest that is
      earned on an investment over a period of
      5 years.  The initial amount of the investment
      and the interest rate are input by the user.
      The value of the investment at the end of each
      year is output.
   */
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      double principal;  // The value of the investment.
      double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
      
      /* Get the initial investment and interest rate from the user. */
      
      TextIO.put("Enter the initial investment: ");
      principal = TextIO.getlnDouble();
      
      TextIO.put("Enter the annual interest rate: ");
      rate = TextIO.getlnDouble();
      
      /* Simulate the investment for 5 years. */
      
      int years;  // Counts the number of years that have passed.
      
      years = 0;
      while (years &lt; 5) {
         double interest;  // Interest for this year.
         interest = principal * rate;
         principal = principal + interest;     // Add it to principal.
         years = years + 1;    // Count the current year.
         System.out.print("The value of the investment after ");
         System.out.print(years);
         System.out.print(" years is $");
         System.out.printf("%1.2f", principal);
         System.out.println();
      } // end of while loop
                       
   } // end of main()
        
} // end of class Interest3
</pre>



<p>And here is an applet which simulates this program.  (Remember that for "console applets"
like this one, if the applet does not respond to your typing, you might have to
click on it to activate it.  In some browsers, you might also need to leave the
mouse cursor inside the applet for it to recognize your typing.)</p>

<p>You should study this program, and make sure that you understand what the
computer does step-by-step as it executes the <span class="code">while</span> loop.</p>





<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.1.3">3.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic If Statement</a>
</h3>


<p>An <span class="newword">if statement</span> tells the computer to take one
of two alternative courses of action, depending on whether the value of a given
boolean-valued expression is true or false. It is an example of a "branching"
or "decision" statement. An <span class="code">if</span> statement has the form:</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> )
    <span class="bnf">statement</span>
else
    <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>When the computer executes an <span class="code">if</span> statement, it evaluates the
boolean expression. If the value is <span class="code">true</span>, the computer executes the
first statement and skips the statement that follows the "<span class="code">else</span>". If
the value of the expression is <span class="code">false</span>, then the computer skips the
first statement and executes the second one. Note that in any case, one and
only one of the two statements inside the <span class="code">if</span> statement is executed.
The two statements represent alternative courses of action; the computer
decides between these courses of action based on the value of the boolean
expression.</p>


<p>In many cases, you want the computer to choose between doing something and
not doing it. You can do this with an <span class="code">if</span> statement that omits the
<span class="code">else</span> part:</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> )
    <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>To execute this statement, the computer evaluates the expression. If the
value is <span class="code">true</span>, the computer executes the <span class="bnf">statement</span> that is contained inside the <span class="code">if</span>
statement; if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, the computer skips that <span class="bnf">statement</span>.</p>


<p>Of course, either or both of the <span class="bnf">statement</span>'s
in an <span class="code">if</span> statement can be a block, so that an <span class="code">if</span> statement
often looks like:</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}
else {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>or:</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>As an example, here is an <span class="code">if</span> statement that exchanges the value of
two variables, <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>, but only if <span class="code">x</span> is greater
than <span class="code">y</span> to begin with. After this <span class="code">if</span> statement has been
executed, we can be sure that the value of <span class="code">x</span> is definitely less than
or equal to the value of <span class="code">y</span>:</p>


<pre>if ( x &gt; y ) {
    int temp;      // A temporary variable for use in this block.
    temp = x;      // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.
    x = y;         // Copy the value of y into x.
    y = temp;      // Copy the value of temp into y.
}</pre>


<p>Finally, here is an example of an <span class="code">if</span> statement that includes an
<span class="code">else</span> part. See if you can figure out what it does, and why it would be
used:</p>


<pre>if ( years &gt; 1 ) {  // handle case for 2 or more years
    System.out.print("The value of the investment after ");
    System.out.print(years);
    System.out.print(" years is $");
}
else {  // handle case for 1 year
    System.out.print("The value of the investment after 1 year is $");
}  // end of if statement
System.out.printf("%1.2f", principal);  // this is done in any case</pre>


<p>I'll have more to say about control structures later in this chapter. But
you already know the essentials. If you never learned anything more about
control structures, you would already know enough to perform any possible
computing task. Simple looping and branching are all you really need!</p>
