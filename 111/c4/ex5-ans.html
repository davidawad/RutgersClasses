<h2>Solution for Programmming Exercise 4.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.5:</h3>
<p>The sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomMosaicWalk.java">RandomMosaicWalk.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a> shows a "disturbance" that wanders around a
grid of colored squares. When the disturbance visits a square, the color of
that square is changed. The applet at the bottom of 
<a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a> 
shows a variation on this idea. In this applet, all the squares start
out with the default color, black. Every time the disturbance visits a square,
a small amount is added to the red component of the color of that square. Write
a subroutine that will add 25 to the red component of one of the squares in the
mosaic. The row and column numbers of the square should be passed as parameters
to the subroutine. Recall that you can discover the current red component of
the square in row <span class="code">r</span> and column <span class="code">c</span> with the function call
<span class="code">Mosaic.getRed(r,c)</span>. Use your subroutine as a substitute for the
<span class="code">changeToRandomColor()</span> subroutine in the program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomMosaicWalk2.java">RandomMosaicWalk2.java</a></span>.
(This is the improved version of the program from <a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a> that uses named constants for
the number of rows, number of columns, and square size.) Set the number of rows
and the number of columns to 80. Set the square size to 5.</p>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>

<hr>
<p>This is an exercise in making a rather small modification to a relatively
complicated existing program.</p>


<p>The only real problem is to write a new subroutine, which I will call
<span class="code">brightenSquare</span>. Much of the program comes directly from
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RandomMosaicWalk.java">RandomMosaicWalk.java</a></span>. The
<span class="code">randomMove()</span> routine is unchanged. The only change in the
<span class="code">main()</span> routine is to substitute a call to <span class="code">brightenSquare</span> for
the call to <span class="code">changeToRandomColor</span>. The subroutines
<span class="code">fillWithRandomColors</span> and <span class="code">changeToRandomColor</span> in the
<span class="code">RandomMosaicWalk2</span> program are not needed in the new program and should be removed. In the
three lines that define the constants, the values are changed according the
instructions in the exercise:</p>


<pre>final static int ROWS = 80;        // Number of rows in the mosaic.
final static int COLUMNS = 80;     // Number of columns in the mosaic.
final static int SQUARE_SIZE = 5;  // Size of each square in the mosaic.</pre>


<p>With these values, the program is interesting to watch for a while.  In the end,
I did make one other small change to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine to make
the program run better:  I change the delay in the call to <span class="code">Mosaic.delay(20)</span>
from 20 to 5 to make the animation run faster.  You
might want to try using shades of green, blue, or gray, instead of red.  Or even
use three disturbances, one incrementing the red component of the color, one incrementing
the green component, and one incrementing the blue.</p>


<p>An outline for the <span class="code">brightenSquare</span> routine is clear:</p>


<pre>Let r be the current red component of the square
Add 25 to r
Set the color components of the square to  r, 0, 0</pre>


<p>The green and blue components of the color will always be zero. However,
they must be specified in the <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor()</span> routine. Written in
Java, the body of the routine is just three lines long:</p>


<pre>static void brightenSquare(int row, int col) {
    int r = Mosaic.getRed(row,col);
    r += 25;
    Mosaic.setColor(row,col,r,0,0);
}</pre>


<p>In fact, you could even write the body of the routine using just one
line:</p>


<pre>Mosaic.setColor(row, col, Mosaic.getColor(row,col) + 25, 0, 0);</pre>


<p>One thing here might bother you: It looks like the value of the red
component of a given square might get bigger than 255 if the disturbance visits
it often enough. But the largest legal value for a color component is 255. What
I haven't told you is that when a value greater than 255 is used for a color
component, <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor</span> will silently change the value to 255. If
this were not the case, it would be necessary to rewrite
<span class="code">brightenSquare</span> to avoid illegal values of <span class="code">r</span>:</p>


<pre>static void brightenSquare(int row, int col) {
    int r = Mosaic.getRed(row,col);
    r += 25;
    if ( r &gt; 255 )
        r = 255;
    Mosaic.setColor(row,col,r,0,0);
}</pre>
