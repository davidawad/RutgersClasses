<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.7:</h3>
<p>Write an animation applet
that shows a checkerboard pattern in which the even numbered rows slide to the
left while the odd numbered rows slide to the right. You can assume that the
applet is 160 by 160 pixels. Each row should be offset from its usual position
by the amount <span class="code">getFrameNumber() % 40</span>. Hints: Anything you draw outside
the boundaries of the applet will be invisible, so you can draw more than 8
squares in a row. You can use negative values of x in
<span class="code">g.fillRect(x,y,w,h)</span>. Here is a working solution to this exercise:
</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="SlidingCheckerboard.class" width="160" height="160" alt=""></applet></p>


<p>Your applet will extend the non-standard class,
<span class="classname">SimpleAnimationApplet2</span>, which was introduced in 
<a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>. The compiled class files,
<span class="code">SimpleAnimationApplet2.class</span> and
<span class="code">SimpleAnimationApplet2$1.class</span>, must be in the same directory as your
Web-page source file along with the compiled class file for your own class. These
files are produced when you compile <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleAnimationApplet2.java">SimpleAnimationApplet2.java</a></span>.
Assuming that the name of your class is <span class="code">SlidingCheckerboard</span>, then the
source file for the Web page should contain the lines:</p>


<pre>&lt;applet code="SlidingCheckerboard.class" width=160 height=160&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;</pre>

<p>Obviously, this exercise builds on the previous exercise, so you should read
and understand the <a href="../c3/ex6-ans.html">solution to the previous exercise</a>
first.</p>


<p>The squares on the checkerboard are 20 pixels on each side. Looking from
left to right, the pattern of red and black squares repeats itself after two
squares, that is, after 40 pixels. If a row moves one pixel per frame, then
after 40 frames, the pattern will look the same as it did in the first frame.
So there are only 40 distinct frames in the animation. The appearance of the
frame is determined by how far each row is offset from its original position.
The offsets are given by 0, 1, 2, ..., 39. This sequence repeats itself over
and over. The proper offset for a given frame can be computed as
<span class="code">getFrameNumber()&nbsp;%&nbsp;40</span>, as noted in the statement of the exercise.</p>


<p>If we just slide a row of eight squares, it will leave a blank area on the
right as the row slides left, or a blank area on the left as the row slides
right. It's useful to think of the checkerboard as being extended by two extra
squares on each side. Only the middle eight squares will be visible. Instead of
8 squares extending from <span class="code">x = 0</span> to <span class="code">x = 160</span>, we have 12 squares
extending from <span class="code">x = -40</span> to <span class="code">x = 200</span>. Even when the rows are
offset by up to two squares, the whole visible area of the applet will be
filled with squares. Here, for example, is what it looks like for an offset of
13 pixels:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="SlidingCheckerboard.gif" width="302" height="193" alt="checkerboard with rows offset"></p>



<p>A white rectangle is drawn around the visible area of the applet. The parts
of the rows outside this rectangle are shown in this picture, and my program
will issue commands for drawing them, but they are not visible when the applet
is run.</p>


<p>With all this figured out, it's not terribly difficult to adapt the solution
from the previous exercise. If we were just drawing a static, 12-column
checkerboard where the first column starts at <span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;-40</span> instead of 
<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span>, the code would be almost identical to the code from that
exercise:</p>


<pre>for ( row = 0;  row &lt; 8;  row++ ) {
   for ( col = 0;  col &lt; 12;  col++ ) {
   
       x = -40 + 20*col;
       y = 20*row;
       
       if ( (row % 2) == (col % 2) )
          g.setColor(Color.red);
       else
          g.setColor(Color.black);
          
       g.fillRect(x,y,20,20);
   }
}</pre>


<p>The only problem is that the starting point of the first square is not -40.
It is offset from -40 by an amount that depends on the frame number. It also
depends on whether the row number is odd or even, since odd rows are offset to
the left and even rows are offset to the right. The amount of offset is
computed as <span class="code">offset&nbsp;=&nbsp;frameNumber()&nbsp;%&nbsp;40</span>. This offset has to be added
to -40 to give the starting point of the row. Let <span class="code">leftEdge</span> be a
variable that will store the starting point of the row. If the row number is
even, <span class="code">leftEdge</span> is computed as <span class="code">-40&nbsp;-&nbsp;offset</span>. If the row number
is even, <span class="code">leftEdge</span> is <span class="code">-40&nbsp;+&nbsp;offset</span>. Adding these computations
to the above code gives a complete algorithm for drawing one frame in the
animation:</p>


<pre>offset = frameNumber() % 40;  // Amount by which each row is offset.

for ( row = 0;  row &lt; 8;  row++ ) {

   if ( row % 2 == 0)    // if row number is even
      leftEdge = -40 - offset;
   else
      leftEdge = -40 + offset;
   
   for ( col = 0;  col &lt; 12;  col++ ) {
   
       x = leftEdge + 20*col;
       y = 20*row;
       
       if ( (row % 2) == (col % 2) )
          g.setColor(Color.red);
       else
          g.setColor(Color.black);
          
       g.fillRect(x,y,20,20);
   }
}</pre>


<p>Once the variable declarations are added, this becomes the body of the
<span class="code">drawFrame()</span> subroutine of the applet. The applet must follow the
general framework for animations based on the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/SimpleAnimationApplet2.java">SimpleAnimationApplet2.java</a></span>,
as given in <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>.</p>
